problem: |-
  This task is about the scoring in the first phase of the die-game
  Yahtzee, where five dice are used. The score is determined by the values
  on the upward die faces after a roll. The player gets to choose a value,
  and all dice that show the chosen value are considered active. The score
  is simply the sum of values on active dice.


  Say, for instance, that a player ends up with the die faces showing 2,
  2, 3, 5 and 4. Choosing the value two makes the dice showing 2 active
  and yields a score of 2 + 2 = 4, while choosing 5 makes the one die
  showing 5 active, yielding a score of 5.


  The method has one parameter <code>toss</code>, a five-element integer
  list, where each element represents the upward face of a die. Return
  the maximum possible score with these values.
constraints: |-
  <ul>
  <LI>
  <code>toss</code> will contain exactly 5 elements.

  <LI>
  Each element of <code>toss</code> will be between 1 and 6, inclusive.
  </ul>
examples: |-
  <ol>
  <li class="example-odd">
  <PRE>

  [ 2, 2, 3, 5, 4 ]

  Returns: 5

  </PRE>
  The example from the text.

  <li class="example-even">
  <PRE>

  [ 6, 4, 1, 1, 3 ]

  Returns: 6

  </PRE>
  Selecting 1 as active yields 1 + 1 = 2, selecting 3 yields 3, selecting
  4 yields 4 and selecting 6 yields 6, which is the maximum number of
  points.

  <li class="example-odd">
  <PRE>

  [ 5, 3, 5, 3, 3 ]

  Returns: 10

  </PRE>
  Two 5's is better than three 3's.

  </ol>
