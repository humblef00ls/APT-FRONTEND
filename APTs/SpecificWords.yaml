problem: >-
  Given a phrase, your task is to determine the number of words that end

  in ending and do not contain item as part of their word.




  Write function <em>countwords </em> that has three string parameters
  <code>phrase</code>,

  <code>ending</code> and

  <code>item</code>.  This function returns an integer representing the

  number of words in phrase that end in ending and  does not contain item as

  part of their word.

  You can assume all words are lowercase.
constraints: |-
  <ul>
  <li> phrase, ending and item are all of length 1 or more characters  </li>
  <li> ending and item are only lowercase alphabetic characters </li>
  <li> ending and item are different words </li>
  <li> phrase is only lowercase alphabetic characters or
  blanks. It starts and ends with an alphabetic character, and if there
  are blanks, there cannot be two adjacent blanks.    </li>
  </ul>
examples: |-
  <ol>
  <li class="example-odd">
  <PRE>
  phrase =  "swim trim shop drop swap rim"
  ending = "im"
  item = "sh"


  returns: 3
  swim, trim and rim all end in "im", none of them have "sh" in them.
  </PRE>


  <li class="example-even">
  <PRE>
  phrase =  "swim trim shop drop swap rim"
  ending = "im"
  item = "sw"

  returns: 2
  "trim" and "rim" all end in "im", and do not have "sw" in it. "swim" ends in
  "im", but has "sw" as part of it.
  </PRE>


  <li class="example-odd">
  <PRE>
  phrase = "duck"
  ending = "uck"
  item = "d"


  returns: 0
  </PRE>



  <li class="example-even">
  <PRE>

  phrase =  "i am lovely crazy silently happily smilingly funny"
  ending = "ly"
  item = "book"


  returns: 4
  lovely, silently, happily, and smilingly all end in "ly" and do not have
  "book" in them.
  </PRE>


  <li class="example-odd">
  <PRE>


  phrase = "book booklet redbook beautiful butterfly"
  ending = "ly"
  item = "book"



  returns: 1

  </PRE>


  <li class="example-even">
  <PRE>

  phrase =  "long song long song some belong and some do not belong"
  ending = "ong"
  item = "son"

  returns: 4
  There are six words that end in "ong": long, song, long, song, belong,
  and belong. Two of those words have "son" in them: song and song,
  so those two do not count.
  </PRE>
