  Terry has created a new book rating system that is based on 1) the number of

  pages read (sometimes Terry cannot finish a book) we will call readpages,

  2) the total number of pages in the book, we will call totalpages, 3) the

  number of days Terry read the book, we will call numdays, and 4) the rating of

  the book on amazon, we will call amazon.

  Here is the formula Terry has come up with:


  <img src="formula.png">



  Given the number of pages read, the total number of

  pages in the book, the number of days Terry read the book and the rating of

  the book on amazon, use Terry's formula to calculate the rating. Terry

  doesn't like float numbers so after calculating the rating, convert the

  rating to an integer by truncating it



  <h3>Constraints/Assumptions</h3>


  <ul>

  <li><code>readpages > 0</code>

  <li><code>totalpages > 0</code>

  <li><code> numdays > 0</code>

  <li><code>rating > 0.0</code>

  </ul>



  <h3>Examples</h3>

  <li class="example-odd">

  <PRE>

  readpages = 356

  totalpages = 356

  numdays = 10

  amazon = 4.12


  returns 100


  The calculated value is 100.08483601425343. That value is trucated to the

  int 100.
