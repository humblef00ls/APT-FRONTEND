problem: |-
  Some voting systems are more "fair" than others. You'll
  write method <code>winners</code> to return a list
  of the winners using a <em>Borda Count</em> voting scheme
  that is typically viewed as consensus based.
  (For more information on
  Borda Count and related voting schemes
  see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borda_count">
  the Wikipedia article</a>).

  Each string in parameter <code>ballots</code> represents
  the ballot, or votes, by one eligible voter. These are
  a single-space delimited string of names where the first
  name is the most-preferred candidate for the voter and
  the last name is the least-preferred candidate. Each voter
  will cast a ballot with the same number of candidates being
  voted for. This number, <tt>N</tt>, is the number of votes the
  most-preferred candidate gets in each ballot. The least-preferred
  candidate gets one vote. The number of votes decreases
  by one from <tt>N</tt> to <tt>N-1</tt> (second name in a ballot) to
  2 (second to last candidate) and 1.

  Return a list of the candidates with the maximal number of votes. If
  this is a single candidate, the list will contain one name. If there
  are multiple candidates with the same number of maximal votes
  return a list of all the candidates sorted alphabetically by name.
constraints: |-
  <ul>
  <li><code>ballots</code> will contain between 1 and
  50 strings, inclusive
  </li>

  Each string in <code>ballots</code> will be a single-space delimited
  set of names. All strings will consist of lower-case letters only
  </li>

  <li>Each string in <code>ballots</code> will contain the same
  number of names</li>

  </ul>
examples: |-
  <ol>
  <li class="example-odd">
  <PRE>
  ballots = ["moe curly larry", "moe larry curly", "curly moe larry"]

  returns ["moe"]
  </PRE>
  moe gets 3+3+2 = 8 votes, curly gets 2+1+3=6 votes, larry gets 1+2+1=4 votes.

  <li class="example-even">
  <PRE>
  ballots = ["chris sam", "sam chris"]

  returns ["chris", "sam']

  </PRE>
  Each candidate gets 3 votes, return the list of names in alphabetical order.

  <li class="example-odd">
  <PRE>
  ballots = ["donald"]

  returns ["donald"]

  </PRE>
  There is only one candidate who gets any votes.
