initial: "def lovely(ingredients,inedible):\n\t\"\"\"\n\treturn int, number of items in\n\tingredients, a string that are edible\n\tusing informaion from  inedible, a string\n\t\"\"\"\n\t\n\t# you write code here"
problem: |-
  Some people have dietary restrictions
  because of health issues, some because
  of religious issues, and some for ethical, moral,
  or other reasons. You must write the function <code>lovely</code>
  that determines how many of the individual ingredients in
  some food/recipe are edible. The String <code>inedible</code>
  is a white-space delimited list of inedible food-stuffs.
  Any ingredient that's not listed in <code>inedible</code> is,
  therefore, edible.
constraints: |-
  <ul>
  <li> All characters in <codE>inedible</code> and
  <code>ingredients</code>
  are upper or lower case 'A'-'Z', 'a'-z'
  <li> The number of "words" (character sequences separated by whitespace)
  in
  <codE>inedible</code> is fewer than 50, similarly for
  <code>ingredients</code> .
  <li> Each word is separated from another word by exactly one space
  in both
  <codE>inedible</code> and
  <code>ingredients</code> .
  <li>All words in <code>ingredients</code> are distinct.
  </ul>
examples: |-
  <ol>
  <li class="example-odd">
  <PRE>
  ingredients = "honey sugar"
  inedible = "rice milk potato"

  returns: 2

  </PRE>
  Each of the two items in ingredients is edible since neither
  is inedible.

  <li class="example-even">
  <PRE>
  ingredients = "pork shrimp marshmallow"
  inedible = "asparagus shrimp lobster crayfish bacon"

  returns: 2

  </PRE>
  shrimp isn't edible, but pork and marshmallow are

  <li class="example-odd">
  <PRE>
  ingredients = "a e i o u"
  inedible = "b c d f g h j k l m n p q r s t v w x y z"

  returns: 5

  </PRE>
  All the vowels are edible since only the consonants are inedible

  <li class="example-even">
  <PRE>
  ingredients = "stuff"
  inedible = "this that the other stuff nonsense"

  returns: 0

  </PRE>
