problem: |-
  Elphaba has decided to try to defy gravity. She's going to drop or throw
  an object from the top of an infinitely tall building and see
  how far it falls. She knows exactly what speed she throws the
  object and has a stop watch she uses to time how long it falls.

  Write function <code>falling</code> that returns the number of
  <em>meters</em> the object has fallen after <code>time</code>
  seconds have elapsed when the object is thrown with
  an initial velocity of <code>velo</code> meters/sec.

  Ignore any forces due to friction, air-resistance, etc. The infinitely
  tall building is located in a vacuum. However, the building is on the
  earth, so accelaration due to earth's gravity should be part
  of your calculations.


  You can find many resources online that give the equation for how far an
  object falls when dropped. That equation is <tt>0.5*g*t<sup>2</sup>
  </tt> where t is time in seconds and <b>g</b> is the gravitational
  constant which is 9.8 meters/seconds<sup>2</sup> (units). When an object
  is thrown the equation is
  <PRE>
  d = v*t + 0.5*g*t<sup>2</sup>

  </PRE>
  Where  v is initial velocity in meters/second and t is time in
  seconds. So simply use that equation, and the value of <b>g =
  9.8</b> in solving this problem.
constraints: |-
  <ul>
  <li> <code>time</code> will be greater than zero and less than
  the number of seconds in a week.

  <li> <code>velo</code> will be non-negative.
  </ul>
examples: |-
  <ol>
  <li class="example-odd">
  <PRE>
  time = 3
  velo = 5

  returns 59.1

  </PRE>
  If you throw an object at 5 m/sec for 3 seconds it will
  have fallen 59.1 meters. Note that 5*3 + 0.5*9.8*3*3 = 15 + 44.10 = 59.10

  <li class="example-even">
  <PRE>
  time = 3
  velo = 0

  returns 44.1

  </PRE>
  If you drop the object instead of throwing it the distance
  will be 44.1 meters.

  <li class="example-odd">
  <PRE>
  time = 3600
  velo = 0

  returns 63504000.0

  </PRE>
  After an hour a dropped object has traveled 63,504 kilometers or nearly 40,000
  miles.

  <li class="example-even">
  <PRE>
  time = 86400
  velo = 0

  returns 36578304000.0

  </PRE>
  After a day the dropped object has traveled more than 22 million miles
