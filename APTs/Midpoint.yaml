initial: "def getPoint(coordinates):\n\t'''\n\tThe function accepts one parameter named coordinates, which is a list containing\n\ttwo strings in the format [\"x1,y1\", \"x2,y2\"], where:\n\t\n\t\"x1,y1\" is an (x,y) coordinate pair for the first point\n\t\n\t\"x2,y2\" is an (x,y) coordinate pair for the second point\n\t\n\tThe function should return a list containing the x and y coordinates of the midpoint in the\n\tformat [x,y].\n\t'''\n\t# you write code here"
problem: >-
  The midpoint between any two points on the Cartesian plane can be calculated
  using the formula:

  <br><br>


  ((x1+x2)/2,  (y1+y2)/2)


  where (x1, y1) are the coordinates for the first point and (x2, y2) are the
  coordinates for the second point.


  Create a function named <code>getPoint</code> that has one parameter named
  coordinates

  (which is a list of two strings in the format ["x1,y1", "x2,y2"]).

  </p>

   The function returns a list that contains two doubles [x,y], which correspond to the x and y coordinates of the midpoint.</p>
constraints: >-
  <ul>

  <li>All coordinates for the two points used to calculate the midpoint are
  integers between -30 and +30.

  <li>The coordinates of the midpoint are expressed as double values.

  <li>There is no space before or after the comma in each coordinate.

  </ul>
examples: >-
  <ol>


  <li class="example-odd">

  <PRE>

  coordinates=["2,2", "2,2"]


  Returns: [2.0, 2.0]

  </PRE>

  # The midpoint between two points that are the same is the same as the two
  points. Note this includes a double

  representation of the midpoint.



  <li class="example-even">

  <PRE>

  coordinates=["-2,2", "2,2"]


  Returns: [0.0, 2.0]

  </PRE>

  The midpoint occurs at (0.0, 2.0).



  <li class="example-odd">

  <PRE>

  coordinates=["-5,-10", "4,3"]


  Returns: [-0.5, -3.5]

  </PRE>




  <li class="example-even">

  <PRE>

  coordinates=["1,0", "-10,-5"]


  Returns: [-4.5, -2.5]

  </PRE>
