  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting">Instant-runoff
  voting</a> is a ranked preferential voting method where every voter strictly
  ranks the candidates by who they would prefer in the position. Ballots are
  then initially counted using each voter's first choice. If no candidate earns
  the majority of the votes (strictly greater than half), the candidate with the
  least votes is removed and all of their votes are distributed based on each of
  those voter's next most preferred candidate.

  </p>


  Implement winner3, which returns the winner of an instant-runoff election
  across three candidates. The input is a list of strings that represent
  ballots. Each string has all three candidates separated by semicolons (;) in
  that voter's ranking with the most preferred candidate first.

  </p>


  If there is no majority winner for the first round, then the candidate with
  the least votes has their votes redistributions between the two other
  candidates. If there is no winner after redistributing the votes, then the
  function should return "Tie".

  </p>


  Assume that if there is no winner in the first round, there will not be a tie
  for who has the least number of votes.
constraints: >-
  <ul>

  <li>There is always at least one voter.

  <li>Every string contains all three candidates under consideration and only
  those candidates

  </ul>

  <ol>


  <li class="example-odd">

  <PRE>

  data = ['Ezekiel;Joyce;Lakia', 'Ezekiel;Joyce;Lakia']


  Returns 'Ezekiel'

  # Both voters most preferred Ezekiel and therefore they won

  </PRE>



  <li class="example-even">

  <PRE>

  data = ['Jackqueline;Mckenzie;Angelena', 'Jackqueline;Mckenzie;Angelena',
  'Jackqueline;Angelena;Mckenzie',

  'Mckenzie;Jackqueline;Angelena',

  'Angelena;Jackqueline;Mckenzie']


  Returns 'Jackqueline'

  # Three of the five voters ranked Jackqueline as their first choice and
  therefore they won. Note there was no need to redistribute the

  # votes of the candidate with the least votes, which means it did not matter
  that there is tie for who has the least votes.

  </PRE>



  <li class="example-odd">

  <PRE>

  data = ['Caroline;Ezekiel;Mariano', 'Caroline;Ezekiel;Mariano',

  'Ezekiel;Caroline;Mariano', 'Ezekiel;Caroline;Mariano',

  'Mariano;Caroline;Ezekiel']


  Returns 'Caroline'

  # Two candidates received 2 votes each, with Mariano receiving only 1 vote
  (the least). Mariano's vote was redistributed to the next person

  # on that voter's ranking, which is Caroline. This resulted in Caroline
  getting 3 votes and therefore receiving a majority of the 5 votes in

  # the data set and winning.

  </PRE>



  <li class="example-even">

  <PRE>

  data = ['Mckenzie;Barney;Isaac', 'Mckenzie;Isaac;Barney',
  'Mckenzie;Barney;Isaac',

  'Barney;Mckenzie;Isaac', 'Barney;Isaac;Mckenzie', 'Barney;Mckenzie;Isaac',
  'Barney;Isaac;Mckenzie',

  'Isaac;Barney;Mckenzie', 'Isaac;Barney;Mckenzie', 'Isaac;Mckenzie;Barney',
  'Isaac;Mckenzie;Barney', 'Isaac;Mckenzie;Barney']


  Returns 'Tie'


  # In the first round Mckenzie had 3 votes, Barney had 4 votes, and Isaac had 5
  votes. Isaac does not win because a majority vote must be

  # more than 6. Mckenzie as the fewest votes, so those votes are redistributed,
  resulting in both Barney and Isaac having 6 votes each,

  # which is a tie, so "Tie" is returned.
