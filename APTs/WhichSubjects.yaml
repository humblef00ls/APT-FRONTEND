initial: "def computeSubjects(phrase):\n\t'''\n\tGiven the string phrase, return a phrase\n\tthat includes all the words from phrase that do\n\tnot contain a digit or \"-\" or \":\". Those words must\n\tbe in the same order they were in  phrase.\n\t'''\n\t\n\t# you write code here"
problem: |-
  Given a phrase, your task is to create a new phrase that includes only
  those
  words from the original phrase that do not have digits in them nor the
  characters ":" or "-".


  You might use this method for example to extract out the subjects of the
  courses that someone is taking. For example if the phrase is:

  <pre>
  "CompSci 101 TuTh1:25pm Econ 101 MW10:05am"
  </pre>

  Then you would return the string "CompSci Econ". You would not include words
  that have digits, ":" or "-", so in this case you would not include any of
  these words: "101",
  "TuTh1:25pm",  "101", and "MW10:05am".



  Write function <em>computeSubjects </em> that has one string
  parameter <code>phrase</code>.
  This function returns a string of the words from phrase, in the same order,
  that do not have a digit, ":", or "-".

  You may want to consider writing a helper function.
constraints: |-
  <ul>
  <li> phrase is of length 1 or more characters  </li>
  <li> phrase is <strong>upper or lowercase </strong>alphabetic
  characters, digits, ":", "-" or
  blanks.
   <li> Blank is the separator between words in phrase. That means phrase starts and ends with a non-blank character, and if there
  are blanks, there cannot be two adjacent blanks.    </li>
  </ul>
examples: |-
  <ol>
  <li class="example-odd">
  <PRE>
  phrase =  "CompSci 101 TuTh1:25pm Econ 101 MW10:05am"


  returns: "CompSci Econ"

  (example above)
  </PRE>


  <li class="example-even">
  <PRE>
  phrase =  "Math 112 CompSci 101 Bio 201 Chem 101"


  returns: "Math CompSci Bio Chem"


  </PRE>


  <li class="example-odd">
  <PRE>
  phrase =  "CompSci101 Econ101"


  returns: ""

  Both words contain a digit, so there are no valid words to return.

  </PRE>



  <li class="example-even">
  <PRE>


  phrase =  "153FS NEUROSCI MW10:05 to11:20 Sec01 Languages207 4989"


  returns: "NEUROSCI"

  NEUROSCI is the only word that does not have a digit or ":" in it.

  </PRE>
