initial: "def weight3(ab,ac,bc):\n\t\"\"\"\n\treturn float indicating\n\tthe total amount of weight for objects a, b and c.\n\tYou are given the combined weight of a and b\n\ttogether as parameter ab, the combined weight of\n\ta and c together as parameter ac,\n\tand the weight of b and c together with parameter bc.\n\t\"\"\"\n\t\n\t# you write code here"
problem: |-
  Given three objects, a, b and c, we can only weigh two of them at a
  time. You want to determine what the weight of all three of them is.

  Write function <code>weight3</code> that is given the weight of the pairs
  of objects a and b together (parameter ab), a and c together (parameter
  ac),
  and b and c together (parameter bc), and returns the total weight
  of all three objects.
constraints: |-
  <ul>
  <li> <code>ab, ac</code>, and <code>bc</code> will be greater than zero.

  </ul>
examples: >-
  <ol>

  <li class="example-odd">

  <PRE>

  ab = 10

  ac = 20

  bc = 24


  returns 27.0


  </PRE>

  a must weigh 3, b must weigh 7, and c must weigh 17, so the total weight is
  27.


  <li class="example-even">

  <PRE>


  ab = 1.5

  ac = 2.5

  bc = 3


  returns 3.5


  </PRE>

  a must weigh .5, b must weigh 1, and c must weigh 2, so the total weight is
  3.5.



  <li class="example-odd">

  <PRE>


  ab = 200

  ac = 300

  bc = 200


  returns 350.0


  </PRE>

  a must weigh 150, b must weigh 50, and c must weigh 150, so the total weight
  is 350.



  <li class="example-even">

  <PRE>

  ab = 60

  ac = 75

  bc = 85


  returns 110.0

  </PRE>

  a must weigh 25, b must weigh 35, and c must weigh 50, so the total weight is
  110
