initial: "def findString(input):\n\t'''\n\tThe string parameter input is comprised of one or\n\tmore words or combinations of words, numbers, and\n\tsymbols.\n\t\n\tThe function should return the number of words in\n\tthe string that end with a vowel.\n\t'''\n\t# you write code here\n\t"
problem: >-
  Given a string, we want to identify all the words contained in the

  string that end with a vowel. Create the function named
  <code>findString</code>

  that has one parameter named input, which is a string.

  </p>


  This function returns the number of words in the string that contain end with
  a vowel.</p>
constraints: >-
  <ul>

  <li>The string parameter <code>input</code> cannot be empty.

  <li>Words in the original string input that end with a vowel, but also are
  followed by a symbol

  (e.g., '.' or ',' or ':' or ';' should not be included in the final count.

  <li>Words that are repeated in the string should be counted each time they
  appear.

  </ul>
examples: >-
  <ol>


  <li class="example-odd">

  <PRE>

  input="Hey you."


  Returns: 0

  </PRE>

  # The last word is 'you.'. However, because a '.' follows the 'u', then it is
  not the last character in the

  substring. Thus, it is not included, and the count is 0.



  <li class="example-even">

  <PRE>

  input="Hey you"


  Returns: 1

  </PRE>

  # The last word is 'you' and it is the only substring that ends in a vowel.



  <li class="example-odd">

  <PRE>

  input="Are you there? I can't hear you"


  Returns: 4

  </PRE>

  # 'there?' is not included because '?'  is the last character in the
  substring. Also, 'you'

  appears twice in the sentence, and is thus counted twice.



  <li class="example-even">

  <PRE>

  input="cat $13ha FIVE yellow submarine"


  Returns: 3

  </PRE>

  # '$13ha' is included in the  count because the substring ends in a vowel.
