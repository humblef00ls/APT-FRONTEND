problem: >-
  Given a phrase of words and a single letter, your task is to determine

  which of the words in phrase have this letter as one of their letters, and

  to return the count of the unique words

  in phrase that have letter in them.




  Write function <em>howMany </em> that has two string parameters

  named <code>phrase</code> and  <code>letter</code>.

  This function returns an integer representing the

  count of the unique words in phrase that have <code> letter</code> in

  them.

  Ignore case for <code>phrase</code>, so the words "That", "that", "ThaT" and
  "THAT" would all be considered

  the same word. You can assume <code>letter</code> is always lowercase.
constraints: |-
  <ul>
  <li> phrase is of length 1 or more characters.  </li>
  <li> words in phrase are separated by blanks.</li>
  <li>phrase starts and ends with an alphabetic character, and if there
  are blanks, there cannot be two adjacent blanks.    </li>
  </li>
  <li> phrase is only alphabetic characters, upper or lowercase </li>
  <li> letter is of length 1   </li>
  <li> letter is only an alphabetic character and is lowercase</li>

  </ul>
examples: |-
  <ol>
  <li class="example-odd">

  phrase = "Duke CompSci graduates are Jedi Masters of the technology sector"
  letter = "d"

  returns: 3
  There are three unique words that contain d: Duke, graduates, and Jedi

  phrase = "This is a very long long long test of this phrase"
  letter = "g"

  returns: 1

  There is just one word with h: how
