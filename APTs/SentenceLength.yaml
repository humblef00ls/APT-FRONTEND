problem: |-
  As part of analyzing readability you've been asked to compute
  the average sentence length of a list of sentences. Each
  sentence is a a white-space delimited string of words. The length
  of a sentence is the number of words in it.

  See the examples for details.
constraints: |-
  <ul>
  <li> <code>sentenceList</code> will have between
  1 and 50 strings in it, inclusive of 1 and 50.
  <li> Each string in <code>sentenceList</code> will
  contain between 1 and 50 words, words delimited by
  whitespace.
  </ul>
examples: |-
  <ol>
  <li class="example-odd">
  <PRE>
  sentenceList = ["the", "cat", "ate", "the", "dog"]

  returns 1.0

  </PRE>
  There are five sentences, each is one word long, average is 1.0.

  <li class="example-even">
  <PRE>
  sentenceList = ["the cat ate", "the dog"]

  returns 2.5

  </PRE>
  There are two sentences. One contains three words, the other
  contains two words. The average is 2.5.

  <li class="example-odd">
  <PRE>
  sentenceList = ["the", "only way", "we can get", "all green is to", "fail"]

  returns 2.2

  </PRE>
  There are five sentences of length 1, 2, 3, 4, 1.



  <li class="example-even">
  <PRE>
  sentenceList = ["four score", "and seven years ago", "things were different"]

  returns 3.0

  </PRE>
  There are three sentences of lengths 2, 4, and 3 (in order that they
  appear
  in <code>sentenceList</code> the average is 9/3 or 3.0
