problem: |-
  You are given information about donors and their contributions.
  Return the name of the most generous donor, the donor who has given
  the most to charity.


  A donor
  may give more than once. Determine the name of the
  donor who has given the largest total amount to charity. If there is more
  than one donor with the largest amount, return the name that comes first
  in alphabetical order.

  For example, if the donor list is the following you'll return "Blue".
  <ol>
  <li> "Sun:70.00"
  <li> "Zebra:80.00"
  <li> "Blue:30.00"
  <li> "Edwards:50.00"
  <li> "Blue:50.00"
  </ol>
   Both "Zebra" and "Blue" gave the most amount, $80.00. Return "Blue"
  as it comes before "Zebra" alphabetically.


  A donation is represented as a string with the name of the donor first
  followed by ":" as the separator, followed by the dollar amount
  given. The
  dollar amount will represent a valid float.
   Given a list of donations (a list of strings), return the
  name of the donor with the largest donation. If there is more than one
  donor with the maximal amount, return the name of the donor
  that comes first alphabetically.
constraints: >-
  <ul>

  <li> <code>contributions</code> is a nonempty list of strings.


  <li> Each character of the strings in <code>contributions</code> will be a
  lowercase

  letter 'a'-'z', upper case 'A'-'Z', digits '0'-'9', '.' or a ':'.


  <li> The format of each string in <code>contributions</code>

  is  "name:amount" where amount is a valid flaot. That is, there will be
  exactly one  ':' in each string

  of <code>contributions</code>. To the right of the ":", the

  remaining

  characters in the string will be in the format of a valid float.
