problem: |-
  Sometimes contests are based on speed, endurance, quality, or quantity
  and various combinations of these traits. It might be who can
  eat the most doughnuts, or who can quaff the most cans of a
  beverage, or who can solve the most APTs, or who can run the
  most consecutive sub 75-second 400 meter laps.

  In this problem you'll be given data for a contest in which each
  contestant has performed some task in some number of
  minutes and seconds. The data will be given for all the tasks in the
  format <tt>"name time"</tt> where name is separated from time
  by one space. The time is in the format <tt>"min:sec"</tt> and
  represents how long it took someone to complete
  the task. The input <code>data</code> is
  a list of tasks done in the contest,
  each string in <data>data</code>
  represents one task.

  Return a list of contestant names in rank order from winner to
  loser. The winningest contestant has performed the most tasks, or
  if there is a tie with another contestant in number of tasks,
  has performed the tasks most quickly.  No contestant will have
  performed the same number of tasks in the same time as any
  other contestant. See the examples for details.
constraints: |-
  <ul>
  <li> <code>data</code> contains between 1 and 50 (inclusive) Strings
  <li> Each element of <code>data</code> is in the proper format. Time
  data will have at most two digits for minutes and for seconds,
  (each) and these will each be values between 0 and 59,
  inclusive.
  <LI> No task takes more than one hour to complete.
  </ul>
examples: >-
  <ol>

  <li class="example-odd">

  <PRE>

  data = ["owen 2:00", "jeff 1:29", "owen 1:00", "jeff 1:30", "robert 0:21"]


  Returns ["jeff", "owen", "robert"]


  </PRE>

  jeff and owen have each performed two tasks compared to robert's one

  task. owen's total time is 3 minutes, jeff's is 2 minutes and

  59 seconds, so jeff is the winner of the contest.


  <li class="example-even">

  <PRE>

  data = ["tyson 0:11", "usain 0:12", "carl 0:30", "carl 0:20", "usain 0:40",
  "carl 1:00"]


  Returns ["carl", "usain", "tyson"]


  </PRE>

  carl performed three tasks,  usain two tasks, and tyson one task.


  <li class="example-odd">

  <PRE>

  data = ["tyson 0:11", "usain 0:12", "carl 0:30", "carl 0:20", "usain 0:40",
  "carl 1:00" "usain 0:57"]


  Returns ["usain", "carl", "tyson"]


  </PRE>

  Like the previous example, but usain has peformed

  one more task--his three tasks completed in in

  57+12+40 seconds or 1:49, while carl's three tasks

  were completed in 1:50.


  <li class="example-even">

  <PRE>

  data = ["kate 4:16", "kate 4:17"]


  returns ["kate"]

  </PRE>
