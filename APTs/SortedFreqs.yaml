initial: "def freqs(data):\n\t\"\"\"\n\treturn list of int values corresponding\n\tto frequencies of strings in data, a list\n\tof strings\n\t\"\"\""
problem: |-
  The frequency with which data occurs is sometimes
  an important statistic.  In this problem you'll determine
  how frequently strings occur and return a list representing
  the frequencies of each different/unique string. The list returned
  contains as many frequencies as there are unique strings.
  The returned frequencies represent an alphabetic/lexicographic ordering
  of the unique words, so the first frequency is how many times the
  alphabetically first word occurs and the last frequency is the
  number of times the alphabetically last word occurs.

  Consider these strings (quotes for clarity, they're not part of the strings).
  <pre>

  ["apple", "pear", "cherry", "apple", "cherry", "pear", "apple", "banana"]

  </pre>
  The list returned is <code>[3,1,2,2]</code> since the alphabetically
  first word is <code>"apple"</code> which occurs 3 times; the second word
  alphabetically is <code>"banana"</code> which occurs once, and the other
  words each occur twice.
constraints: |-
  <ul>
  <LI> <code>data</code> will contain at most 50 elements

  <LI> each element of <code>data</code> will contain at most 50 characters,
  all characters are lowercase.
  </ul>
examples: >-
  <ol>

  <li class="example-odd">

  <PRE>


  data = ["apple", "pear", "cherry", "apple", "cherry", "pear", "apple",
  "banana"]


  Returns: [3,1,2,2]

  </PRE>

  This is the example given above.


  <li class="example-even">

  <PRE>


  data = ["a","b","c",d"]


  Returns [1,1,1,1]


  </PRE>


  <li class="example-odd">

  <PRE>


  data = ["a","a","a"]


  Returns [3]


  </PRE>
