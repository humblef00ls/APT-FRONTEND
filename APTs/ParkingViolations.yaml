initial: "def amountOwed(ticket, months):\n\t'''\n\tThe following parameters are input to the function:\n\tticket-the original ticket amount.\n\tmonths-the number of months that the fine is late.\n\t\n\t\n\tThe function should return the current amount owed, which includes\n\tthe parking fee plus all late fees.\n\t'''\n\t# you write code here\n\t"
problem: >-
  Campus parking has instituted new policies for late parking violations.

  For every month that a parking ticket remains unpaid, the penalty is

  5% of the current balance owed (including prior months late penalties,

  if applicable).


  Create a function named <code>amountOwed</code> that has two parameters

  named ticket (which is the original ticket amount) and months (which is the

  number of months that the fine is late).

  </p>


  This function should return the current amount owed for the parking

  violation, rounding up to the nearest dollar amount (every penny
  counts!!).</p>
constraints: |-
  <ul>
  <li>The original parking fine is between 1 and 200 dollars.
  <li>The number of months a ticket can be late is 1 to 24 months.


  </ul>

  <li class="example-odd">

  <PRE>

  ticket=100

  month=2


  Returns: 111

  </PRE>

  # The amount owed in fines is $110.25. However, because campus parking rounds
  up, the

  total amount owed is $111.



  <li class="example-even">

  <PRE>

  ticket=25

  month=15


  Returns: 52

  </PRE>




  <li class="example-odd">

  <PRE>

  ticket=50

  month=5


  Returns: 64

  </PRE>




  <li class="example-even">

  <PRE>

  ticket=75

  month=6


  Returns: 101
