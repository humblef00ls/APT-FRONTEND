initial: "def modify(name):\n\t\"\"\"\n\tname is a string with zero or more spaces\n\twith one space between each \"word\"\n\treturn string \"last, first MI. MI. MI. ...\"\n\twhere MI is middle initial\n\t\"\"\"\n\t\n\t# you write code here\n\treturn name"
problem: |-
  Sabrina needs to be able to reorganize names into the last name first and
  she wants to abbreviate any middle names with the first letter and a
  period. She respects middle names that are a single letter and does
  <b>not</b> abbreviate them.



  Write function <code>modify</code> that given a name returns the name with
  the last name first, followed by a comma,
  followed by the first name (if any), followed by the first letter of
  each remaining/middle name with a period after each letter. If
  a middle name is a single letter, do not abbreviate it/follow it by a period.
constraints: |-
  <ul>
  <li> <code>name</code> will have at least one word

  </ul>
examples: >-
  <ol>

  <li class="example-odd">

  <PRE>

  name = "Barak Hussein Obama"


  returns "Obama, Barak H."

  </PRE>


  <li class="example-even">

  <PRE>

  name = "Prince"


  returns "Prince"


  There is only one name.

  </PRE>


  <li class="example-odd">

  <PRE>

  name = "Thomas Narten"


  returns "Narten, Thomas"


  There is no middle name.

  </PRE>


  <li class="example-even">

  <PRE>

  name = "Elizabeth Rosemond Hilton Wilding Todd Fisher Burton Warner Fortensky
  Taylor"


  returns "Taylor, Elizabeth R. H. W. T. F. B. W. F."


  All the middle names are abreviated.


  </PRE>


  <li class="example-odd">

  <PRE>

  name = "Bala X Krish"


  returns "Krish, Bala X"


  Don't abbreviate one letter words.


  </PRE>


  <li class="example-even">

  <PRE>

  name = "Liz A Bo To Joe"


  returns "Joe, Liz A B. T."


  All the middle names are abreviated except A which was of length 1"


  </PRE>
