problem: >-
  You have several trophies sitting on a shelf in a straight line. Their

  heights are given in a list of int values, <code>trophies</code>, from left to
  right. The shelf is

  positioned so that whenever people enter your room, they see it directly

  from the left side. In other words, the leftmost trophy is completely

  visible to the viewer, the next trophy in line is directly behind it,

  and so on.




  Unfortunately, tall trophies near the left side of the shelf might block

  the view of other trophies. A trophy is visible only if every trophy in

  front of it (from the viewer's perspective) is strictly shorter than it

  is. You wonder if rotating the shelf 180 degrees would increase the

  number of visible trophies.




  Return a int list containing exactly two elements. The first element

  should be the number of trophies visible when viewing the shelf directly

  from the left side, and the second element should be the number of

  trophies visible when viewing the shelf directly from the right side.
constraints: |-
  <ul>
  <li> <code>trophies</code> contains between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive
  <li> Each element of <code>trophies</code> will be between 1 and 100,
  inclusive
  </ul>
examples: |-
  <ol>
  <li class="example-odd">
  <PRE>
  trophies = [1,2,3,4,5]

  Returns: [5, 1]

  </PRE>
  When viewed from the left, each trophy is taller than all the trophies
  in front of it. However, when viewed from the right, the first trophy
  blocks the view of all the other trophies.


  <li class="example-even">
  <PRE>
  trophies = [5,5,5,5]

  Returns: [1,1]

  </PRE>
  Since all trophies have the same height, only the first is visible when
  viewed from each direction.

  <li class="example-odd">
  <PRE>
  trophies = [1,2,5,2,1]

  Returns: [3, 3]

  </PRE>
  This trophy shelf is symmetric.

  <li class="example-even">
  <PRE>
  trophies = [1,4,2,5,3,7,1]

  Returns: [4,2]

  </PRE>

  </ol>
