problem: >-
  You have two lists: <code>parents</code> and <code>children</code>.

  The ith element in <code>parents</code> is the parent of the ith element in
  <code>children</code>.

  Count the number of grandchildren (the children of a person's children) for
  the person in the <code>person</code> variable.


  Hint: Consider making a helper function that returns a list of a person's
  children.
constraints: |-
  <ul>
  <li>There is no incest (two siblings having a child together).
  <li>No one has the same name as another person.
  <li>The person in the person variable is in the parents list.
  </ul>
examples: >-
  <ol>


  <li class="example-odd">

  <PRE>

  parents = ['Sanjay', 'Ellie']

  children = ['Ellie', 'Nicolas']

  person =  'Sanjay'


  Returns 1

  </PRE>

  # Sanjay has one child, Ellie. Ellie has one child, Nicolas. Therefore, Sanjay
  has one grandchild, Nicolas.



  <li class="example-even">

  <PRE>

  parents = ['Austin', 'Sanjay', 'Jiayi']

  children = ['Emily', 'Emily', 'Sanjay']

  person =  'Jiayi'


  Returns 1

  </PRE>

  # Jiayi has one child Sanjay. Austin and Sanjay (we do not judge people for
  the cultural gender of their name) have one child, Emily. Therefore, Jiayi has
  one grandchild, Emily.



  <li class="example-odd">

  <PRE>

  parents = ['Nathan']

  children = ['Jachin']

  person =  'Nathan'


  Returns 0

  </PRE>

  # This just has a single relationship of Nathan is the parent of Jachin.
  Therefore, there are no grandchildren.



  <li class="example-even">

  <PRE>

  parents = ['Isabella', 'Michael', 'Jacob', 'Isabella']

  children = ['Ashabur', 'Ashabur', 'Isabella', 'Lydia']

  person =  'Jacob'


  Returns 2

  </PRE>

  # Jacob has one child, Isabella. Isabella has two children, Ashabur (whoâ€™s
  other parent is Michael) and Lydia (who has no other parent, this is not a
  complete family tree). Therefore, Jacob has two grandchildren.



  <li class="example-odd">

  <PRE>

  parents = ['Junhua', 'Anshul', 'Junhua', 'Anshul', 'Kerry']

  children = ['Anshul', 'Jordan', 'Kerry', 'Paul', 'Kai']

  person =  'Junhua'


  Returns 3

  </PRE>

  # Junhua has two children, Anshula and Kerry. Anshul has two children (Jordan
  and Paul), while Kerry has one child (Kai). So Junhua has three grandchildren
