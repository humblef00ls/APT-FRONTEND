problem: |-
  Strange abbreviations are often used to write text messages on
  uncomfortable mobile devices. One particular strategy for encoding texts
  composed of alphabetic characters and spaces is the following:

  <ul>
  <li> Spaces are maintained, and each word is encoded individually. A word is
  a consecutive string of alphabetic characters.
  <li>
  If the word is composed only of vowels, it is written exactly as in the
  original message.
  <li>
  If the word has at least one consonant, write only the consonants that
  do not have another consonant immediately before them. Do not
  write any vowels.
  <li>
  The letters considered vowels in these rules are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o' and
  'u'. All other letters are considered consonants.
  </ul>


  For instance, "ps i love u" would be abbreviated as "p i lv u" while
  "please please me" would be abbreviated as "ps ps m".  You will be given
  the original message in the string
  parameter <code>original</code>. Return a string with the
  message abbreviated using the described strategy.
constraints: |-
  <ul>
  <li> <code>original</code> will contain between 1 and 50 characters, inclusive
  <li> Each character of <code>original</code> will be a lower case
  letter 'a'-'z' or a space.

  <li>  There will not be two consecutive spaces
  in <code>original</code>.
  </ul>
examples: |-
  <ol>
  <li class="example-odd">
  <PRE>
  "text message"

  Returns "tx msg"
  </PRE>

  <li class="example-even">
  <PRE>
  "ps i love u"

  Returns: "p i lv u"
  </PRE>

  <li class="example-odd">
  <PRE>
  "please please me"

  Returns: "ps ps m"
  </PRE>

  <li class="example-even">
  <PRE>
  "back to the ussr"

  Returns "bc t t s"
  </PRE>

  <li class="example-odd">
  <PRE>
  "aeiou bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxyz"

  Returns: "aeiou b"
  </PRE>
  </ol>
