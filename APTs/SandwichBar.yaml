problem: |-
  It's time to get something to eat and I've come across a sandwich
  bar. Like most people, I prefer certain types of sandwiches. In fact, I
  keep a list of the types of sandwiches I like.

  The sandwich bar has certain ingredients available. I will list the
  types of sandwiches I like in order of preference and buy the first
  sandwich the bar can make for me. In order for the bar to make a
  sandwich for me, it must include all of the ingredients I desire.

  Given <code>available</code>, a list of Strings/ingredients the
  sandwich bar can use, and a <code>orders</code>, a list of Strings
  that represent the types of
  sandwiches I like, in order of preference (most preferred first), return
  the 0-based index of the sandwich I will buy. Each element of
  <code>orders</code> represents one type of sandwich I like as a
  space-separated list of ingredients in the sandwich. If the bar can make
  no sandwiches I like, return -1.
constraints: "<ul>\n<li>\t<code>available</code>\nwill contain between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive.\n<li>\tEach element of <code>available</code>\nwill contain between 1 and 50 lowercase letters ('a' - 'z'), inclusive.\n<li> <code>orders</ocde> will contain between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive.\n<li> Each element of <code>orders</code> will\ncontain between 1 and 50 lowercase letters ('a' - 'z') and spaces, inclusive.\n\n<li> Each element of <code>orders</code> will represent a list of\ndesired ingredients separated by single spaces, with no leading or\ntrailing spaces.\n</ul>"

  <li class="example-odd">

  <PRE>


  available = [ "ham", "cheese", "mustard" ]


  orders = [ "ham cheese" ]


  Returns: 0


  </PRE>


  I only like plain ham and cheese sandwiches, and since both ham and cheese are
  available, I'll take that.



  <li class="example-even">

  <PRE>



  available = [ "cheese", "mustard", "lettuce" ]


  orders = [ "cheese ham", "cheese mustard lettuce", "ketchup", "beer" ]


  Returns: 1


  </pre>

  They've run out of ham, but I'll consider other options now.


  <li class="example-odd">

  <PRE>


  available = [ "cheese", "cheese", "cheese", "tomato" ]


  orders = [ "ham ham ham", "water", "pork", "bread", "cheese tomato cheese",
  "beef" ]


  Returns: 4


  </PRE>

  Ignore any duplicate elements in the lists.


  <li class="example-even">

  <PRE>


  available = [ "foo", "bar", "baz", "gazonk", "quux", "bat", "xyzzy",

  "shme", "hukarz", "grault", "waldo", "bleh" ]


  orders = [ "kalatehas", "spam eggs", "needle haystack", "bleh blarg", "plugh",

  "the best sandwich in the universe" ]


  Returns: -1
