problem: |-
  You are always over your yearly budget at the end of the year.In an
  effort to become more fiscally responsible, you've decided to
  track your total amount spent, by month. You also want to understand
  how much you've spent in total at any point in the year.

  Given a list of your spending by month and a yearly limit, create
  the function named <code>expenses</code> that has two parameters named
  spending (a list of spending, by month)) and limit(the total amount that
  can be spent for the year).
  </p>

  This function returns a string that represents the first month where
  the total amount spent for the year (up through that month) exceeds
  the yearly limit.</p>
constraints: >-
  <ul>

  <li>The list named spending should only contain 12 integers.

  <li>Each item in the list named spending should range between 0 and 700.

  <li>The minimum amount that your yearly spending can total is 10.

  <li>The limit must be an integer that is less than the total amount spent

  over the entire year.

  <li>The string returned as the month should have the full month name (no
  abbreviations

  allowed).

  <li>The string returned as the month should only have the first letter of the

  month capitalized (e.g., "January", "February", "March", etc.)

  spending=[10,33,500,0,5,100,210,55,90,100,150,111]

  limit=600


  Returns: "June"

  </PRE>

  # The first month that the yearly limit (600) is exceeded is in June, when 100
  is

  spent for the month, making the total spent through June 648.

  # The total spent through May is 1177, which exceeds the 1000 yearly limit.
