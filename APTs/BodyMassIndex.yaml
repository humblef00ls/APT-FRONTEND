problem: |-
  Body mass index (BMI) is a measure of body size, which is often calculated
  by medical professionals. BMI is calculated based on a person's height and
  weight. How this calculation depends on the metrics used.

  For height in inches and weight in pounds, BMI is calculated as:
  <br><br>
  (weight/height<sup>2</sup>) x 703
  </p>

  Given a list of a patient's weight and height, we want to determine a
  person's BMI. Create the function named <code>calculateBMI</code> that has
  one parameter named input, which is a list of integers. The list is in the
  format [weight, height], where weight is the person's weight, and height
  is a person's height.
  </p>

  This function returns the BMI, based on the input.</p>
constraints: |-
  <ul>
  <li>The list only contains one weight and one height.
  <li>weight is an integer in the range of 1-800.
  <li>height is an integer in the range of 1-84.
  <li>The BMI returned is an integer value that rounds down to the closest
  integer.
  </ul>
examples: >-
  <ol>


  <li class="example-odd">

  <PRE>

  input=[100,60]


  Returns: 19

  </PRE>

  # A person who is 5ft tall and weighs 100 lbs has a BMI of 19.527777777777775.

  However, because we're only considering the integer portion, only 19 is
  returned



  <li class="example-even">

  <PRE>

  input=[160,65]


  Returns: 26

  </PRE>

  # A person who is 5ft 5in tall and weighs 160 lbs has a BMI of
  26.622485207100592.

  However, because we're only considering the integer portion, only 26 is
  returned



  <li class="example-odd">

  <PRE>

  input=[80,50]


  Returns: 22

  </PRE>

  # A person who is 4ft 2in tall and weighs 80 lbs.



  <li class="example-even">

  <PRE>

  input=[325,77]


  Returns: 38

  </PRE>

  # A person who is 6ft 5in tall and weighs 325 lbs.
