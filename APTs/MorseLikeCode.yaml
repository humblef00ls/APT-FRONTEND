problem: >-
  Marge is rather concerned about who her son has been

  spending time with. Aside from all of the time spent at the arcade, they

  communicate with each other through encrypted messages. As a concerned

  parent, Marge wants to discover what the boys are talking about.



  Marge knows parts of the boys' code <code>library</code>, given as a

  list of strings. Each

  element is formatted as "C SEQUENCE" (quotes for clarity), where C is an

  uppercase letter, SEQUENCE consists of only '-' and '.'  characters, and

  exactly one space separates the two. When writing their message, the

  boys will replace C with SEQUENCE, separating multiple letters with

  spaces. So, if O is represented as "---" and S is represented as "...",

  then the message "SOS" can be encoded as "... --- ...".



  Marge has recovered an encoded message that she would like to

  decode. Unfortunately, she does not have a full copy of the
  <code>library</code>, so

  there may be some SEQUENCEs that do not correspond to any entries in the

  <code>library</code>; if this happens, you are to replace it with a '?' (Marge
  is a

  smart mom, and might be able to figure out what the word is with only

  partial information). You are to return a String containing the decoded

  message.
constraints: "<ul>\n<LI>\t<code>library</code> will contain between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive.\n<LI> Each element of <code>library</code> will contain between 3 and 50\ncharacters, inclusive.\n<LI> Each element of <code>library</code> will be formatted as \"C SEQUENCE\" as\ndescribed in the problem statement.\n<LI> In each element of <code>library</code>, C will be an uppercase letter\n('A'-'Z').\n<LI> In each element of <code>library</code>, SEQUENCE will consist only of '.'\nand '-'.\n<LI> There will be no duplicate SEQUENCEs in <code>library</code>.\n<LI> <code>message</code> will contain between 1 and 50 characters, inclusive.\n<LI> Each character of <code>message</code> will be '-', '.', or a space (' ').\n<LI> There will be no leading, trailing, or consecutive spaces in <code>message</code>.\n\n</ul>"
examples: |-
  <ol>
  <li class="example-odd">
  <PRE>
  library = ["O ---",
  "S ..."]
  message = "... --- ..."

  Returns: "SOS"

  </PRE>
  The example from the problem statement.

  <li class="example-even">
  <PRE>
  library = ["O ---"]
  message = "... --- ..."

  Returns: "?O?"

  </PRE>
  This time we don't have the S, so we replace the three dashes with
  question marks.

  <li class="example-odd">
  <PRE>

  </PRE>
  library =
  ["H -",
  "E .",
  "L --",
  "L ..",
  "O -."]
  message = "- . -- .. -."

  Returns: "HELLO"


  Note that the clever boys can have multiple ways to encode the same letter.

  <li class="example-even">
  <PRE>
  library = [
  "H -.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.",
  "I .-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-",
  "K -.-.-.-.-.",
  "E .-.-.-.-.-"]
  message = "-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-. .-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-"

  Returns: "HI"

  </PRE>
  A long message doesn't always mean a long word.
  <li class="example-odd">
  <PRE>
  library =
  ["O ---",
  "S ...",
  "B -...",
  "T -",
  "R .-.",
  "E .",
  "N -.",
  "X -..-",
  "D -.." ]

  message = "-... --- ... - --- -. .-. . -.. ... --- -..-"

  Returns: "BOSTONREDSOX"

  </PRE>
  <li class="exmample=even">

  <PRE>
  library =
  ["A --",
  "B -.",
  "N ...-",
  "I --..",
  "F -.-.-."]

  message = "-. -- -.-.-. -.-.-. --- --.. ...- .-..--."

  Returns: "BAFF?IN?"
