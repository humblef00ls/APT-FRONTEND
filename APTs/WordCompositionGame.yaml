problem: |-
  Three players are playing a game of word composition in which each
  player writes down a list of words. After the time expires the scores
  are calculated using the following rules. Each player gains 3 points for
  each unique word that only he has, 2 points for each word that is shared
  with exactly one other player, and 1 point for each word that is shared
  with both of the other players.


  You will be given three string lists <code>listA</code>,
  <code>listB</code> and <code>listC</code> - the word lists of
  playerA, playerB and playerC respectively. Your method should return
  scores of playerA, playerB and playerC in the form of the string
  "scoreA/scoreB/scoreC" (quotes for clarity).
constraints: >-
  <ul>


  <LI>

  <code>listA</code>, <code>listB</code> and <code>listC</code> will have
  between 1 and 50 elements each,

  inclusive.

  <LI>

  Each element of <code>listA</code>, <code>listB</code> and <code>listC</code>
  will contain between 1 and 20

  characters, inclusive.

  <LI> Each element of <code>listA</code>, <code>listB</code> and
  <code>listC</code> will contain only lowercase

  letters ('a'-'z').

  <P<LI> All elements in <code>listA</code> will be distinct.

  <LI> All elements in <code>listB</code> will be distinct.

  <LI> All elements in <code>listC</code> will be distinct.
