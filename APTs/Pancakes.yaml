problem: |-
  You're a short-order cook in a pancake restaurant, so you need to cook
  pancakes as fast as possible. You have one pan that can fit
  <code>capacity</code> pancakes at a time. Using this pan you must cook
  <code>numCakes</code> pancakes.  Each pancake must be cooked for five
  minutes on each side, and once a pancake starts cooking on a side it has
  to cook for five minutes on that side. However, you can take a pancake
  out of the pan when you're ready to flip it after five minutes and put
  it back in the pan later to cook it on the other side.

  Write the method, <code>minutesNeeded,</code> that returns the shortest
  time needed to cook <code>numCakes</code> pancakes in a pan that holds
  <code>capacity</code> pancakes at once. See the examples.
constraints: |-
  <ul>
  <LI>The integer <code>numCakes</code> is a non-negative number less than 1000
  (i.e., <code>0 &le; numCakes &lt; 1000</code>).

  <LI>The integer <code>capacity</code> is a positive number less than 101
  (i.e., <code>1 &le; capacity &lt; 101</code>).

  </ul>
examples: |-
  <ol>
  <li class="example-odd">
  <PRE>
  numCakes = 0
  capacity = 4

  Returns: 0

  </PRE>

  It takes no time to cook 0 pancakes.

  <li class="example-even">
  <PRE>
  numCakes = 2
  capacity = 2

  Returns: 10

  </PRE>
  You cook both pancakes on one side for five minutes, then flip them over
  and cook each on the other side for another five minutes.

  <li class="example-odd">
  <PRE>
  numCakes = 3
  capacity = 2

  Returns: 15

  </PRE>
  You cook pancakes 1 and 2 on one side for five minutes, then you take
  pancake 2 out of the pan, flip pancake 1 and start cooking pancake
  3. After 10 minutes, pancake 1 is done so you take it out, pancake 3 can
  be flipped, and you can put pancake 2 back in the pan (since you removed
  the first pancake). Total time: 15 minutes.
  </PRE>
