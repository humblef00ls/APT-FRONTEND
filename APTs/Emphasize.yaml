  Given a word and a number we want to emphasize the first part of the word

  by repeating the first part "number" times. But there are a few rules about

  what you can repeat. Your code should follow these rules.



  <ul>

  <li> If the first letter starts with a vowel, there is <em>no change</em> to
  the word.

  </li>

  <li> If none of the first three letters is a vowel, then

  there is <em>no change</em> to the word.

  </li>

  <li> If the third letter is a vowel, then the first three letters are

  repeated <tt>number</tt> times.

  </li>

  <li> If the third letter is not a vowel, but the second letter is a vowel,

  the the first two letters are repeated <tt>number</tt> times.

  </li>

  <li> Only the first letter of the returned word may be a capital letter,

  and then only if the original word started with a capital letter.

  </li>


  </ul>


  Write function <code>repeat</code> that given a word and a number returns

  the word with the first part repeated <tt>number</tt> times

  if the first part is valid (there is a vowel, but the first letter

  is not a vowel, see rules).
constraints: |-
  <ul>
  <li> <code>word</code> is formed of alphabetic letters and only the
  first letter will be a capital letter.
  </li>

   <li> There is at least one letter in
  <code>word</code>. Be sure to consider how to handle words that are of
  length one or two.
  </li>

  <li> <code>number </code> is greater than 1
  </li>

  </ul>
examples: |-
  <ol>
  <li class="example-odd">
  <PRE>
  word = "Chocolate"

  number = 3

  returns "Chochochocolate"
  </PRE>
  since the third letter is a vowel so "cho" is
  repeated
  three times

  <li class="example-even">
  <PRE>
  word = "banana"

  number = 4

  returns "babababanana"
  </PRE>
  The second letter is a vowel, so "ba" is repeated four times.

  <li class="example-odd">
  <PRE>
  word = "apple"

  number = 2

  returns "apple"
  </PRE>
  Starts with a vowel, so no change.

  <li class="example-even">
  <PRE>
  word = "Foofy"

  number = 4

  returns "Foofoofoofoofy"

  </PRE>

  <li class="example-odd">
  <PRE>
  word = "stripe"

  number = 3

  returns "stripe"
  </PRE>

  Neither the second or third letter are a vowel, so no change.

  <li class="example-even">
  <PRE>
  word = "Abercrombie"

  number = 6

  returns "Abercrombie"
  </PRE>

  Starts with a vowel, so no change.
