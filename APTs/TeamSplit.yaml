problem: >-
  You want to split some people into two teams to play a game. In order to

  make the split, you first designate two team captains who take alternate

  turns selecting players for their teams. During each turn, the captain

  selects a single player for his team. Since each captain wants to make

  the strongest possible team, he will always select the best available

  player. The players have strengths, which are given in int list parameter

  <code>strengths</code>, where higher numbers indicate better players. After
  all the

  players have been selected, the team strength is computed as the sum of

  the strengths of the players on that team.


  For example, if <code>strengths</code>=[5,7,8,4,2], then the first captain
  selects

  the player with strength 8 for his team, the second captain gets the

  player with strength 7, the first gets the one with strength 5, the

  second the one with strength 4, and the last one (strength 2) goes to

  the first team. The first team now has a total strength 8+5+2=15, and

  the second team has strength 7+4=11.


  Return the absolute strength difference between the two teams. For the

  example above you should return 4 (=15-11).
constraints: |-
  <ul>
  <li>
  <code>strengths</code> will have between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive.

  <li>
  Each element of <codE>strengths</code> will be between 1 and 1000, inclusive.
  </ul>
examples: |-
  <ol>
  <li class="example-odd">
  <PRE>
  strengths = [5,7,8,4,2]

  Returns: 4

  </PRE>
  The example from the problem statement.

  <li class="example-even">
  <PRE>
  strengths = [100]

  Returns: 100

  </PRE>
  A boring game with only one player. The second team has strength 0 (no
  players).

  <li class="example-odd">
  <PRE>
  strengths = [1000,1000]

  Returns: 0

  </PRE>
  Both teams with equal strength.

  <li class="example-even">
  <PRE>
  strengths = [9,8,7,6]

  Returns: 2
