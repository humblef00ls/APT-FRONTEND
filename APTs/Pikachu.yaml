problem: |-
  Pikachu is a well-known character in the Pokemon anime series. Pikachu
  can speak, but only 3 syllables: "pi", "ka", and "chu". Therefore
  Pikachu can only pronounce strings that can be created as a
  concatenation of one or more syllables he can pronounce. For example, he
  can pronounce the words "pikapi" and "pikachu".



  You are given a String word. Your task is to check whether Pikachu can
  pronounce the string. If the string can be produced by concatenating
  copies of the strings "pi", "ka", and "chu", return
  <tt>"YES"</tt> (quotes for
  clarity). Otherwise, return <tt>"NO"</tt>.
constraints: |-
  <ul>
  <li> <code>word</code> contains between 1 and 50 characters, inclusive
  <li> each character of <code>word</code> will be a lower-case letter 'a'-'z'
  </ul>
examples: |-
  <ol>
  <li class="example-odd">
  <PRE>
  word = "pikapi"

  Returns: "YES"

  </PRE>
  "pikapi" = "pi" + "ka" + "pi", so Pikachu can say it.

  <li class="example-even">
  <PRE>
  word = "pipikachu"

  Returns: "YES"

  </PRE>
  This time we have "pipikachu" = "pi" + "pi" + "ka" + "chu", so Pikachu
  can say it as well.


  <li class="example-odd">
  <PRE>

  word = "pikaqiu"

  Returns: "NO"

  </PRE>
  Pikachu can't say "pikaqiu" since 'q' does not appear in "pi", "ka", or
  "chu".

  <li class="example-even">
  <PRE>
  word = "chupikachupipichu"
  Returns: "YES"

  </PRE>

  <li class="example-odd">
  <PRE>
  word = "duke"
  Returns: "NO"

  </PRE>
  </ol>
