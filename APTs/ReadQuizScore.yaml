problem: >-
  You are a student in a class with reading quizzes. To help you always know
  your current reading quiz grade you've decided to write a function that will
  return the percentage score on your reading quizzes!


  An example syllabus is: "You will receive full credit for the reading quizzes
  if you earn 75% of the available points. We calculate your reading quiz score
  by counting up all of the points you earned and divide by 75% of all the
  points possible."


  Your function has three parameters. <code>total</code> is the number of points
  you received on all of the reading quizzes combined.
  <code>availablePoints</code> is the total number of points across all of the
  reading quizzes were worth. <code>cutOff</code> is an integer between 0 and
  100 representing the percent of points you need to earn full credit. The
  function's return value is the percentage score and therefore between 0.0 and
  100.0 of type float.
constraints: |-
  <ul>
  <li>The integer <code>total</code> is greater than or equal to 0
  <li>The integer <code>availablePoints</code> is greater than or equal to 0
  <li>The integer <code>cutOff</code> is between 0 and 100 inclusive

  </ul>
examples: |-
  <ol>

  <li class="example-odd">
  <PRE>
  total = 60
  availablePoints = 100
  cutOff = 75

  Returns 80.0

  In this case, 75% of the points would be 75. You got 60,
  so your score is 60/75 = 80%
  </PRE>


  <li class="example-even">
  <PRE>
  total = 6
  availablePoints = 16
  cutOff = 75

  Returns 50.0

  In this case, 75% of the points would be 12 points.
  You got 6 points, which is 50% of the total points
  you needed to get.
  </PRE>


  <li class="example-odd">
  <PRE>
  total = 81
  availablePoints = 100
  cutOff = 80

  Returns 100.0

  In this case, the cutoff is 80, meaning you must get at least 80% of the
  points.  Since the total number of points available is 100, that means you
  must get at least 80 points. You got 81 points, which is more than 80% of the
  points, so you get 100%.
