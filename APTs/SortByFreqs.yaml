problem: |-
  The frequency with which data occurs is sometimes an important
  statistic.  In this problem you are given
  a list of strings and must determine how frequently the strings
  occur. Return a list of strings that is sorted (ordered) by
  frequency. The first element of the returned list is the most
  frequently occurring string, the last element is the least frequently
  occurring. Ties are broken by listing strings in
  lexicographic/alphabetical order. The returned list contains one
  occurrence of each
  unique string from the list parameter.



  Consider these strings (quotes for clarity, they're not part of the strings).
  <pre>

  ["apple", "pear", "cherry", "apple", "pear", "apple", "banana"]

  </pre>
  The list returned is:
  <pre>
  [ "apple", "pear", "banana", "cherry" ]
  </pre>
  since the most frequently occurring string is
  <code>"apple"</code> which occurs 3 times; the string
  <code>"pear"</code>
  occurs twice and the other strings each occur once so they are
  returned in alphabetical order.
constraints: |-
  <ul>
  <LI> <code>data</code> will contain at most 500 elements
  <LI> each element of <code>data</code> will contain at most 50 characters,
  all characters are lowercase.
  </ul>
examples: |-
  <ol>
  <li class="example-odd">
  <PRE>

  data = ["apple", "pear", "cherry", "apple", "pear", "apple", "banana"]

  Returns: ["apple", "pear", "banana", "cherry" ]
  </PRE>

  This is the example given above.

  <li class="example-even">
  <PRE>
  data = ["a","b","c",d"]

  Returns: ["a","b","c",d"]
  </PRE>

  <li class="example-odd">
  <PRE>
  data = ["d","c","b","a"]

  Returns: ["a","b","c",d"]

  </PRE>

  <li class="example-even">
  <PRE>

  data = ["a","a","a"]

  Returns ["a"]

  </PRE>
  </ol>
