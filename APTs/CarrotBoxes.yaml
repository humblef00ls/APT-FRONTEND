problem: |-
  Rabbit Hanako has N boxes of carrots numbered 0 through N-1. The i-th
  box contains <code>carrots[i]</code> carrots. (Note that
  <code>carrots</code> is the name of a list that contains information
  about boxes of the vegetable named <em>carrot</em>.)



  She decides to eat <code>amount</code> carrots from these boxes. She
  will eat the carrots one at a time, each time choosing a carrot from the
  box with the greatest number of carrots. If there are multiple such
  boxes, she will choose the lowest numbered box among them.


  Return the number of the box from which she will eat her last carrot.
constraints: |-
  <ul>
  <li> <code>carrots</code> will contain between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive.
  <li> Each element of <code>carrots</code> will be between 1 and 100, inclusive
  <li> <code>amount</code> will be between 1 and the sum of all
  elements of <codE>carrots</code>, inclusive
  </ul>
examples: |-
  <ol>
  <li class="example-odd">
  <PRE>
  carrots = [5,8]

  amount = 3

  Returns: 1
  </PRE>

  She will choose three carrots from the box with index 1.

  <li class="example-even">
  <PRE>
  carrots = [5,8]

  amount = 4

  Returns: 0
  </PRE>

  After she chooses three carrots from box 1, both boxes contain 5
  carrots. She will choose the 4th carrot from the box with
  the lowest index.

  <li class="example-odd">
  <PRE>
  carrots = [4,9,5]

  amount = 18

  Returns: 2
  </PRE>

  <li class="example-even">
  <PRE>
  carrots = [13, 75, 24, 55]

  amount = 140

  Returns: 0
  </PRE>

  <li class="example-odd">
  <PRE>
  carrots = [14,36,52,86,27,97,3,67]

  amount = 300

  Returns: 4
  </PRE>
  </ol>
