<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
<p>

Terry has created a new book rating system that is based on 1) the number of
pages read (sometimes Terry cannot finish a book) we will call readpages,
2) the total number of pages in the book, we will call totalpages, 3) the
number of days Terry read the book, we will call numdays, and 4) the rating of
the book on amazon, we will call amazon.
Here is the formula Terry has come up with:

<p>
Given the number of pages read, the total number of
pages in the book, the number of days Terry read the book and the rating of
the book on amazon, use Terry's formula to calculate the rating. Terry
doesn't like float numbers so after calculating the rating, convert the
rating to an integer by truncating it

<h3>Constraints/Assumptions</h3>

<ul>
<P><li><code>readpages > 0</code>
<P><li><code>totalpages > 0</code>
<P><li><code> numdays > 0</code>
<P><li><code>rating > 0.0</code>
</ul>


<h3>Examples</h3>
<ol>

<li class="example-odd">
<PRE>
  readpages = 356
  totalpages = 356
  numdays = 10
  amazon = 4.12

  returns 100

  The calculated value is 100.08483601425343. That value is trucated to the
  int 100.

<li class="example-even">
  <PRE>
  readpages = 580
  totalpages = 580
  numdays = 50
  amazon = 4.89

  returns 20
</PRE>
<P>
<li class="example-odd">
<PRE>
  readpages = 250
  totalpages = 267
  numdays = 42
  amazon = 3.1

  returns 22
