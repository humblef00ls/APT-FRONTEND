<h3>Specification</h3>

  filename: Family.py

  def grandchildren(parents, children, person):
      '''
      parents (list of strings) - list of parent names corresponding to the
          children list
      children (list of strings) - list of child names corresponding to the
          parents list
      person (string) - a person listed in parents
          
      Return the number of grandchildren for the person in the person variable

<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
You have two lists: <code>parents</code> and <code>children</code>.
The ith element in <code>parents</code> is the parent of the ith element in <code>children</code>.
Count the number of grandchildren (the children of a person's children) for the person in the <code>person</code> variable.
<p>
Hint: Consider making a helper function that returns a list of a person's children.

</div> 
<P>
<h3>Constraints</h3>
<ul>
<P><li>There is no incest (two siblings having a child together).
<P><li>No one has the same name as another person.
<P><li>The person in the person variable is in the parents list.
</ul>


<h3>Examples</h3>
<ol>

<li class="example-odd">
<PRE>
parents = ['Sanjay', 'Ellie']
children = ['Ellie', 'Nicolas']
person =  'Sanjay'

Returns 1
</PRE>
# Sanjay has one child, Ellie. Ellie has one child, Nicolas. Therefore, Sanjay has one grandchild, Nicolas.
<P>

<li class="example-even">
<PRE>
parents = ['Austin', 'Sanjay', 'Jiayi']
children = ['Emily', 'Emily', 'Sanjay']
person =  'Jiayi'

Returns 1
</PRE>
# Jiayi has one child Sanjay. Austin and Sanjay (we do not judge people for the cultural gender of their name) have one child, Emily. Therefore, Jiayi has one grandchild, Emily.
<P>

<li class="example-odd">
<PRE>
parents = ['Nathan']
children = ['Jachin']
person =  'Nathan'

Returns 0
</PRE>
# This just has a single relationship of Nathan is the parent of Jachin. Therefore, there are no grandchildren.
<P>

<li class="example-even">
<PRE>
parents = ['Isabella', 'Michael', 'Jacob', 'Isabella']
children = ['Ashabur', 'Ashabur', 'Isabella', 'Lydia']
person =  'Jacob'

Returns 2
</PRE>
# Jacob has one child, Isabella. Isabella has two children, Ashabur (whoâ€™s other parent is Michael) and Lydia (who has no other parent, this is not a complete family tree). Therefore, Jacob has two grandchildren.
<P>
  
<li class="example-odd">
<PRE>
parents = ['Junhua', 'Anshul', 'Junhua', 'Anshul', 'Kerry']
children = ['Anshul', 'Jordan', 'Kerry', 'Paul', 'Kai']
person =  'Junhua'

Returns 3
</PRE>
# Junhua has two children, Anshula and Kerry. Anshul has two children (Jordan and Paul), while Kerry has one child (Kai). So Junhua has three grandchildren
