def computeNames(team1, count, team2):
    '''
    You have three parameters, team1, 
    count, and team2. 
    The two string parameters are
    named team1 and team2, where both 
    of them are a string of peoples names, 
    with words separated by blanks. 
    Each name on a team is exactly two words.
    The count parameter is an integer
    and indicates the number of teams. It 
    will always have the value 2.
    This function returns a string of the
    unique first names that are only
    in one of the teams. The names should
    appear in alphabetical order.

<h2>Problem Statement</h2>

Given the names of players for two teams, your
task is to determine the <strong> unique first names
that are only on one of the teams. </strong> Those names should be 
returned in alphabetical order.  
Note that there could be duplicate first names in a team, or between two
teams. 

<p> 
<p>

Write function <em>computeNames </em> that has three parameters that are two string
parameters <code>team1</code> and <code>team2</code> and an integer
parameter <code> count</code>, indicating the number of teams, which will always have the value 2. This function
returns a string of the unique first names that appear in only one of the
teams. Those names are returned in alphabetical order. 
<p>
The format of both <code>team1</code> 
and <code>team2</code> is a string of words separated by blanks, with each
name containing two words that are a first name followed by a last name. 

<p> The parameter count will always have the value 2 and is the second
  parameter, between team1 and team2. We are only using this parameter 
because the APT tester prints out team1 and team2 without quotation
  marks. With count printed between them as 2, you can tell where team 1
  ends and team2 begins when the APT tester shows you the input.  


<p>
For example, suppose that <code> team1</code> and <code>team2</code> are
the following strings (and count will be 2):

<pre>
 team1 = "Joe Smith Wes Smith Joe Wright Craig Wills"
 count = 2
 team2 = "Bill Carter Wes Mitchell Craig Smith"
 
</pre>


<p>
Then <code>team1</code> has four players on its  team: Joe Smith, Wes Smith,
Joe Wright and Craig Wills, and <code>team2</code> has three players on its team:
Bill Carter, Wes Mitchell, and Craig Smith. 

Then computeNames for these two teams would return the string "Bill Joe"
because Bill is a first name on team2 and not anyones first name on team1;
and Joe  is a first name on team1 and is not anyones first name on
team2. All the other first names appear on both teams.

<P>
<h3>Constraints</h3>

<ul>
<P><li> <strong> count will always be 2 </strong>. There will always be
    two teams. You don't need to do anything to this variable in your
    code.  </li> 

<p><li> Both <code>team1</code> and <code>team2</code> are a string of 2 or more words,
    separated by blanks. They both will have an even number of words.
    Each word has at least one letter, its first letter is a capital letter
    and the remaining letters are formed only of lowercase alphabetic
    characters. </li>
<p><li> Both  <code>team1</code> and <code>team2</code> start with an alphabetic
    character and end with an alphabetic character and cannot have two
    adjacent blanks.</li>
<p><li> <code>team1</code> may have the same number or a different number of words
    than  <code>team2</code> </li> 
<p><li> There could be duplicate words in team1 or team2 or between the
    two.  </li>
</ul>


<h3>Examples</h3>
<ol>
<li class="example-odd">
<PRE>
team1 = "Joe Smith Wes Smith Joe Wright Craig Wills"
count = 2
team2 = "Bill Carter Wes Mitchell Craig Smith"
 
returns: "Bill Joe"

The example above.
</PRE>

<P>
<li class="example-even">
<PRE>
team1 = "Joe Smith Wes Smith Joe Wright Craig Wills"
count = 2
team2 = "John Pixel Bill Carter Wes Mitchell Craig Smith"


returns: "Bill Joe John"

"John and Bill are both in team2 but not team1, Joe is in team1 but not in
team2. The remaining names appear in both teams. 

Note: Joe appears more than once, but only one Joe is returned. The names
returned  are in alphabetical order. 
</PRE>

<P>
<li class="example-odd">
<PRE>

team1 = "Wes Smith"
count = 2
team2 = "Wes Pixel"

returns: ""

There are no first names that appear only on one team. 
</PRE>
<P>

<P>
<li class="example-even">
<PRE>
team1 = "Wes Smith"
count = 2
team2 = "John Pixel"


returns: "John Wes"

Both first names appear only on one team. 
</PRE>

<P>
<li class="example-odd">
<PRE>
team1 = "Mia Borger Sarah Espinosa Mia Harris Jason Rose Frank Taylor Jason Keim"
count = 2
team2 = "Sarah Yang Hannah Walter Dustin Nicholson Sarah Borger Hannah Kim"


returns: "Dustin Frank Hannah Jason Mia"

Sarah is the only name that appears on both teams. 
</PRE>

<P>
<li class="example-even">
<PRE>
team1 = "Annie Yang Thomas Zenker Thomas Wang"
count = 2
team2 = "Hannah Walter Dustin Nicholson Hannah Borger Sarah Kim"

returns: "Annie Dustin Hannah Sarah Thomas"

Every first name is only on one team.
