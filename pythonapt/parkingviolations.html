  filename: ParkingViolations.py

  def amountOwed(ticket, months):
      '''
      The following parameters are input to the function:
        ticket-the original ticket amount.
        months-the number of months that the fine is late.
	  
     	   
      The function should return the current amount owed, which includes

<h2>Problem Statement</h2>

Campus parking has instituted new policies for late parking violations. 
For every month that a parking ticket remains unpaid, the penalty is
5% of the current balance owed (including prior months late penalties, 
if applicable). 

<p>Create a function named <code>amountOwed</code> that has two parameters 
named ticket (which is the original ticket amount) and months (which is the
number of months that the fine is late).
</p>

<p>This function should return the current amount owed for the parking
violation, rounding up to the nearest dollar amount (every penny counts!!).</p>

</div> 
<P>
<h3>Constraints</h3>
<ul>
<P><li>The original parking fine is between 1 and 200 dollars.
<P><li>The number of months a ticket can be late is 1 to 24 months.


</ul>


<h3>Examples</h3>
<ol>

<li class="example-odd">
<PRE>
ticket=100
month=2

Returns: 111
</PRE>
# The amount owed in fines is $110.25. However, because campus parking rounds up, the 
total amount owed is $111.
<P>

<li class="example-even">
<PRE>
ticket=25
month=15

Returns: 52
</PRE>

<P>

<li class="example-odd">
<PRE>
ticket=50
month=5

Returns: 64
</PRE>

<P>

<li class="example-even">
