<h3>Specification</h3>

  filename: Pikachu.py

  def check(word):

<h2>Problem Statement</h2>


Pikachu is a well-known character in the Pokemon anime series. Pikachu
can speak, but only 3 syllables: "pi", "ka", and "chu". Therefore
Pikachu can only pronounce strings that can be created as a
concatenation of one or more syllables he can pronounce. For example, he
can pronounce the words "pikapi" and "pikachu".
<P>


You are given a String word. Your task is to check whether Pikachu can
pronounce the string. If the string can be produced by concatenating
copies of the strings "pi", "ka", and "chu", return 
<tt>"YES"</tt> (quotes for
clarity). Otherwise, return <tt>"NO"</tt>.

<h3>Constraints</h3>

<ul>
<P><li> <code>word</code> contains between 1 and 50 characters, inclusive
<P><li> each character of <code>word</code> will be a lower-case letter 'a'-'z'
</ul>


<h3>Examples</h3>
<ol>
<li class="example-odd">
<PRE>
word = "pikapi"

Returns: "YES"

</PRE>
"pikapi" = "pi" + "ka" + "pi", so Pikachu can say it.
<P>
<li class="example-even">
<PRE>
word = "pipikachu"

Returns: "YES"

</PRE>
This time we have "pipikachu" = "pi" + "pi" + "ka" + "chu", so Pikachu
can say it as well.

<P>
<li class="example-odd">
<PRE>

word = "pikaqiu"

Returns: "NO"

</PRE>
Pikachu can't say "pikaqiu" since 'q' does not appear in "pi", "ka", or
"chu".
<P>
<li class="example-even">
<PRE>
word = "chupikachupipichu"
Returns: "YES"

</PRE>
<P>
<li class="example-odd">
<PRE>
word = "duke"
Returns: "NO"

</PRE>
</ol>
