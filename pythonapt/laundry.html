<h2>Problem Statement</h2>

Consider the problem of trying to do a number of loads of laundry, given
only one washer and one dryer. Washing a load takes 25 minutes, drying a
load takes 25 minutes, and folding the clothes in a load takes 10
minutes, for a total of 1 hour per load (assuming that the time to
transfer a load is built into the timings given). 10 loads of laundry can be
done in 10 hours, 600 minutes, using the method of completing one load
before starting the next one. Though it can be done faster, see examples.&nbsp;
<P>
Write the method, <code>minutesNeeded,</code> that  returns the shortest time needed to do <code>m</code> loads of laundry. In other words, given an 
integer value representing the number of loads to complete, <code>m</code>, determine the smallest number of minutes
needed to complete all loads of laundry.

<h3>Constraints</h3>

<ul>
<LI> The value of <code>m</code> &lt; 10000

</ul>


<h3>Examples</h3>
<ol>
<li class="example-odd">
<PRE>
m = 1

returns: 60 

</PRE>

You must wash the laundry, 25 minutes, dry the laundry, 25 more minutes,
and fold the laundry, 10 more minutes; for a total of 60 minutes.
<P>

<li class="example-even">
<PRE>

m = 2

returns: 85

</PRE>
You wash the first load of laundry, then dry it, and fold it. While it
is drying, you start washing the second load of laundry. When it
finishes, the first load is done drying, so you can start drying the
second load. You can fold the first load while the second load is
drying, but you need ten extra minutes to fold the last load.

<P>
<li class="example-odd">
<PRE>

m = 3

returns: 110

</PRE>
You wash the first load of laundry, then dry it, and fold it. While it
is drying, you start washing the second load of laundry. When it
finishes, the first load is done drying, so you can start drying the
second load. Since the washer is free again, you can start the last
load. When the second load finishes drying, the last load is finished
washing so you can start it drying. You can fold the first two loads
while the third load is drying, but you need ten extra minutes to fold
the last load.
