<h3>Specification</h3>

  filename: Badges.py

  def findLabel(labels,deeds,needs):
      """
      return string based on parameters
      labels a list of strings
      deeds a list of strings
      and needs a list of strings

<h2>Problem Statement</h2>

You are helping to assign badges based on accomplishments.
The accomplishments completed by a participant are specified
in the list of strings <code>deeds</code> where each element
of <code>deeds</code> is a completed accomplishment. 
<P>
The names of badges are specified in the list <code>labels</code>.
For each element of <code>labels</code> there is a corresponding
set of accomplishments in the list <code>needs</code> to earn that 
corresponding badge, so that earning the badge with name <code>labels[0]</code>
(the first element of <code>labels</code>) requires completing
each of the accomplishments in <code>needs[0]</code>. Similarly,
earning badge with name <code>labels[k]</code> requires
completing each of the accomplishments in <code>needs[k]</code>.
<P>
Return the name of the first badge earned (lowest index), or return the
string <code>"nobadge"</code> if no badge is earned. Strings
in <code>needs</code> are space-delimited words that indicate
the accomplishments needed to earn a badge. See examples for details.
<P>

</div> 
<P>
<h3>Constraints</h3>

<ul>
<P><li> There will be no more than 20 strings in
	  <code>labels</code></li>
<p><LI> The number of strings of <code>labels</code> will be the same
	  as the number of strings in <code>needs</code>. </li>
<P><li> The string <code>"nobadge"</code> will not appear in
	      <code>labels</code>. </li>
<p><li>Strings in <code>needs</code> consist of space-separated characters.
<P><LI>All strings consist only of upper- and lower-case letters 'A'-'Z'
	  and 'a'-'z' or spaces in <code>needs</code>.
</ul>


<h3>Examples</h3>
<ol>
<li class="example-odd">
<PRE>
labels = ['wolf', 'bear', 'lion']
deeds = ["fire", "camping", "spanish"]
needs = ["fire knots camping", "spanish fire internet", "fire camping spanish"]

Returns 'lion'
</PRE>
wolf requires three accomplishments, including knots, which is not in deeds. 
bear requires internet which
	  is not in deeds. All three accomplishments to earn lion
are in deeds.
<P>
<li class="example-even">
<PRE>
labels = ['beginner', 'novice', 'intermediate', 'expert']
deeds = ['skip', 'hop', 'wobble']
needs = ['skip run walk talk', 'wobble teeter fall skip', 
         'skip hop', 'skip hop wobble']

returns 'intermediate'
</PRE>
Although both intermediate and expert badges can be earned, you must
	  return
the first badge (with the lowest index) earned. Since 'talk' is not in
<tt>deeds</tt> and is required for the 'beginner' badge, that badge is
not earned. Similarly neither 'fall' nor 'teeter' are in <tt>deeds</tt>,
so 'novice' cannot be earned.
<P>
<li class="example-odd">
<PRE>
labels = ['first', 'second', 'third', 'fourth']
deeds = ['code', 'talk', 'plan', 'run']
needs = ['code talk plan think', 'talk plan run think', 'plan run code think', 'run code talk think']

returns "nobadge"

</PRE>
All the badges require knowing how to think, which is not in <tt>deeds</tt>,
so no badge can be earned.
<P>
<li class="example-even">
<PRE>
labels = ['first', 'second', 'third', 'fourth']
deeds = ['code', 'talk', 'plan', 'run']
needs = ['code talk plan think', 'talk plan run ', 'plan run code think', 'run code talk think']

returns "second"

</PRE>
Only the second badge doesn't require thinking.
