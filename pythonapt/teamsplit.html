<h2>Problem Statement</h2>

You want to split some people into two teams to play a game. In order to
make the split, you first designate two team captains who take alternate
turns selecting players for their teams. During each turn, the captain
selects a single player for his team. Since each captain wants to make
the strongest possible team, he will always select the best available
player. The players have strengths, which are given in int list parameter
<code>strengths</code>, where higher numbers indicate better players. After all the
players have been selected, the team strength is computed as the sum of
the strengths of the players on that team.
<P>
For example, if <code>strengths</code>=[5,7,8,4,2], then the first captain selects
the player with strength 8 for his team, the second captain gets the
player with strength 7, the first gets the one with strength 5, the
second the one with strength 4, and the last one (strength 2) goes to
the first team. The first team now has a total strength 8+5+2=15, and
the second team has strength 7+4=11.
<P>
Return the absolute strength difference between the two teams. For the
example above you should return 4 (=15-11).

<h3>Constraints</h3>

<ul>
<P><li>
<code>strengths</code> will have between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive.

<P><li>
Each element of <codE>strengths</code> will be between 1 and 1000, inclusive.
</ul>


<h3>Examples</h3>
<ol>
<li class="example-odd">
<PRE>
strengths = [5,7,8,4,2]

Returns: 4
