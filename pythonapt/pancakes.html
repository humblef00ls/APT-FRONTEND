<h3>Specification</h3>

<h2>Problem Statement</h2>

You're a short-order cook in a pancake restaurant, so you need to cook
pancakes as fast as possible. You have one pan that can fit
<code>capacity</code> pancakes at a time. Using this pan you must cook
<code>numCakes</code> pancakes.  Each pancake must be cooked for five
minutes on each side, and once a pancake starts cooking on a side it has
to cook for five minutes on that side. However, you can take a pancake
out of the pan when you're ready to flip it after five minutes and put
it back in the pan later to cook it on the other side.
<P>
Write the method, <code>minutesNeeded,</code> that returns the shortest
time needed to cook <code>numCakes</code> pancakes in a pan that holds
<code>capacity</code> pancakes at once. See the examples.


</div> 
<P>
<h3>Constraints</h3>

<ul>
<LI>The integer <code>numCakes</code> is a non-negative number less than 1000 
    (i.e., <code>0 &le; numCakes &lt; 1000</code>).
    <P>
<LI>The integer <code>capacity</code> is a positive number less than 101
    (i.e., <code>1 &le; capacity &lt; 101</code>).
    <P>  
</ul>


<h3>Examples</h3>
<ol>
<li class="example-odd">
<PRE>
numCakes = 0
capacity = 4

Returns: 0

</PRE>

It takes no time to cook 0 pancakes.
<P>
<li class="example-even">
<PRE>
numCakes = 2
capacity = 2

Returns: 10

</PRE>
You cook both pancakes on one side for five minutes, then flip them over 
and cook each on the other side for another five minutes.
<P>
<li class="example-odd">
<PRE>
numCakes = 3
capacity = 2

Returns: 15

</PRE>
You cook pancakes 1 and 2 on one side for five minutes, then you take
pancake 2 out of the pan, flip pancake 1 and start cooking pancake
3. After 10 minutes, pancake 1 is done so you take it out, pancake 3 can
be flipped, and you can put pancake 2 back in the pan (since you removed
the first pancake). Total time: 15 minutes.
</PRE>
