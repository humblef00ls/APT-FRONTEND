<h2>Problem Statement</h2>

Strange abbreviations are often used to write text messages on
uncomfortable mobile devices. One particular strategy for encoding texts
composed of alphabetic characters and spaces is the following:
<P>
<ul>
<li> Spaces are maintained, and each word is encoded individually. A word is
	a consecutive string of alphabetic characters.
<P><li>
If the word is composed only of vowels, it is written exactly as in the
	original message.
<p><li>
If the word has at least one consonant, write only the consonants that
	do not have another consonant immediately before them. Do not
	write any vowels.
<p><li>
The letters considered vowels in these rules are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o' and
	'u'. All other letters are considered consonants.
</ul>
<P>

For instance, "ps i love u" would be abbreviated as "p i lv u" while
"please please me" would be abbreviated as "ps ps m".  You will be given
the original message in the string 
parameter <code>original</code>. Return a string with the
message abbreviated using the described strategy.


</div> 
<P>
<h3>Constraints</h3>

<ul>
<P><li> <code>original</code> will contain between 1 and 50 characters, inclusive
<P><li> Each character of <code>original</code> will be a lower case
	  letter 'a'-'z' or a space.

<P><li>  There will not be two consecutive spaces
	  in <code>original</code>.
</ul>

<li class="example-odd">
