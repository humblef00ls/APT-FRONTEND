<h3>Specification</h3>
<xmp>
   filename: SortByFreqs.py

   def sort(data):
       """
       return list of strings based on
       the list of strings in parameter data
       """
</xmp>
</div>
<h2>Problem Statement</h2>

The frequency with which data occurs is sometimes an important
statistic.  In this problem you are given
a list of strings and must determine how frequently the strings
occur. Return a list of strings that is sorted (ordered) by
frequency. The first element of the returned list is the most
frequently occurring string, the last element is the least frequently
occurring. Ties are broken by listing strings in
lexicographic/alphabetical order. The returned list contains one
occurrence of each
unique string from the list parameter.


<P>
Consider these strings (quotes for clarity, they're not part of the strings).
<pre>

["apple", "pear", "cherry", "apple", "pear", "apple", "banana"]

</pre>
The list returned is:
<pre>
   [ "apple", "pear", "banana", "cherry" ]
</pre> 
since the most frequently occurring string is
<code>"apple"</code> which occurs 3 times; the string
<code>"pear"</code>
occurs twice and the other strings each occur once so they are
returned in alphabetical order.


</div> 
<P>
<h3>Constraints</h3>

<ul>
<P><LI> <code>data</code> will contain at most 500 elements
<P><LI> each element of <code>data</code> will contain at most 50 characters,
all characters are lowercase.
</ul>


<h3>Examples</h3>
<ol>
<li class="example-odd">
<PRE>

data = ["apple", "pear", "cherry", "apple", "pear", "apple", "banana"]

Returns: ["apple", "pear", "banana", "cherry" ]
</PRE>
<P>
This is the example given above.
<P>
<li class="example-even">
<PRE>
data = ["a","b","c",d"]

Returns: ["a","b","c",d"]
</PRE>
<P>
<li class="example-odd">
<PRE>
data = ["d","c","b","a"]

Returns: ["a","b","c",d"]

</PRE>
<P>
<li class="example-even">
<PRE>

data = ["a","a","a"]

Returns ["a"]

</PRE>
</ol>
