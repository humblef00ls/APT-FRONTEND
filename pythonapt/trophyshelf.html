<h2>Problem Statement</h2>

You have several trophies sitting on a shelf in a straight line. Their
heights are given in a list of int values, <code>trophies</code>, from left to right. The shelf is
positioned so that whenever people enter your room, they see it directly
from the left side. In other words, the leftmost trophy is completely
visible to the viewer, the next trophy in line is directly behind it,
and so on.
<P>


Unfortunately, tall trophies near the left side of the shelf might block
the view of other trophies. A trophy is visible only if every trophy in
front of it (from the viewer's perspective) is strictly shorter than it
is. You wonder if rotating the shelf 180 degrees would increase the
number of visible trophies.
<P>


Return a int list containing exactly two elements. The first element
should be the number of trophies visible when viewing the shelf directly
from the left side, and the second element should be the number of
trophies visible when viewing the shelf directly from the right side.

<P>
<h3>Constraints</h3>

<ul>
<P><li> <code>trophies</code> contains between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive
<P><li> Each element of <code>trophies</code> will be between 1 and 100,
	  inclusive
</ul>


<h3>Examples</h3>
<ol>
<li class="example-odd">
<PRE>
trophies = [1,2,3,4,5]

Returns: [5, 1]

</PRE>
When viewed from the left, each trophy is taller than all the trophies
in front of it. However, when viewed from the right, the first trophy
blocks the view of all the other trophies.
<P>

<li class="example-even">
<PRE>
trophies = [5,5,5,5]

Returns: [1,1]

</PRE>
Since all trophies have the same height, only the first is visible when
	  viewed from each direction.
<P>
<li class="example-odd">
<PRE>
trophies = [1,2,5,2,1]

Returns: [3, 3]

</PRE>
This trophy shelf is symmetric.
<P>
<li class="example-even">
<PRE>
trophies = [1,4,2,5,3,7,1]

Returns: [4,2]

</PRE>

</ol>
