<h3>Specification</h3>
<xmp>
  filename: StringSearch.py

  def findString(input):
      '''
      The string parameter input is comprised of one or 
      more words or combinations of words, numbers, and 
      symbols.
	  
      The function should return the number of words in  
      the string that end with a vowel.
      '''
	# you write code here

</xmp>
</div>
<h2>Problem Statement</h2>

<p>Given a string, we want to identify all the words contained in the
string that end with a vowel. Create the function named <code>findString</code> 
that has one parameter named input, which is a string.
</p>

<p>This function returns the number of words in the string that contain end with a vowel.</p>

</div> 
<P>
<h3>Constraints</h3>
<ul>
<P><li>The string parameter <code>input</code> cannot be empty.
<P><li>Words in the original string input that end with a vowel, but also are followed by a symbol
(e.g., '.' or ',' or ':' or ';' should not be included in the final count.
<P><li>Words that are repeated in the string should be counted each time they appear.
</ul>


<h3>Examples</h3>
<ol>

<li class="example-odd">
<PRE>
input="Hey you."

Returns: 0
</PRE>
# The last word is 'you.'. However, because a '.' follows the 'u', then it is not the last character in the 
substring. Thus, it is not included, and the count is 0.
<P>

<li class="example-even">
<PRE>
input="Hey you"

Returns: 1
</PRE>
# The last word is 'you' and it is the only substring that ends in a vowel.
<P>

<li class="example-odd">
<PRE>
input="Are you there? I can't hear you"

Returns: 4
</PRE>
# 'there?' is not included because '?'  is the last character in the substring. Also, 'you'
appears twice in the sentence, and is thus counted twice.
<P>

<li class="example-even">
<PRE>
input="cat $13ha FIVE yellow submarine"

Returns: 3
</PRE>
# '$13ha' is included in the  count because the substring ends in a vowel.
<P>

</ol>
