def howMany(phrase, letter):
    '''
    Given string parameters phrase and letter, 
    where letter is one character and phrase is a
    string of words separated by a blank, return 
    the count of the unique words in phrase 
    that have letter in them

<h2>Problem Statement</h2>

Given a phrase of words and a single letter, your task is to determine
which of the words in phrase have this letter as one of their letters, and
to return the count of the unique words
in phrase that have letter in them. 

<p> 
<p>
Write function <em>howMany </em> that has two string parameters
named <code>phrase</code> and  <code>letter</code>. 
This function returns an integer representing the
count of the unique words in phrase that have <code> letter</code> in
them. 
Ignore case for <code>phrase</code>, so the words "That", "that", "ThaT" and "THAT" would all be considered
the same word. You can assume <code>letter</code> is always lowercase.
