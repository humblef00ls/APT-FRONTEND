  def weight3(ab,ac,bc):
      """
      return float indicating 
      the total amount of weight for objects a, b and c.
      You are given the combined weight of a and b 
      together as parameter ab, the combined weight of 
      a and c together as parameter ac,
      and the weight of b and c together with parameter bc.

<h2>Problem Statement</h2>

Given three objects, a, b and c, we can only weigh two of them at a
time. You want to determine what the weight of all three of them is. 
<P>
Write function <code>weight3</code> that is given the weight of the pairs
of objects a and b together (parameter ab), a and c together (parameter
ac), 
and b and c together (parameter bc), and returns the total weight 
of all three objects. 
</div> 
<P>
<h3>Constraints</h3>

<ul>
<P><li> <code>ab, ac</code>, and <code>bc</code> will be greater than zero.

</ul>


<h3>Examples</h3>
<ol>
<li class="example-odd">
<PRE>
ab = 10
ac = 20
bc = 24

returns 27.0

</PRE>
a must weigh 3, b must weigh 7, and c must weigh 17, so the total weight is 27.
<P>
<li class="example-even">
<PRE>

ab = 1.5
ac = 2.5
bc = 3

returns 3.5

</PRE>
a must weigh .5, b must weigh 1, and c must weigh 2, so the total weight is 3.5.

<P>
<li class="example-odd">
<PRE>

ab = 200
ac = 300
bc = 200

returns 350.0

</PRE>
a must weigh 150, b must weigh 50, and c must weigh 150, so the total weight is 350.

<P>
<li class="example-even">
<PRE>
ab = 60
ac = 75
bc = 85

returns 110.0
</PRE>
a must weigh 25, b must weigh 35, and c must weigh 50, so the total weight is 110

</ol>
