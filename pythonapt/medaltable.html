<h2>Problem Statement</h2>


The Olympic Games will be held, and have been held (and might be being
held).  Given the results of the olympic disciplines, generate and
return the medal table.
<P>
The results of the disciplines are given as a <codE>String list</code> 
results</code>, where each element is in the format "GGG SSS BBB". GGG,
SSS and BBB are the 3-letter country codes (three capital letters from
'A' to 'Z') of the countries winning the gold, silver and bronze medal,
respectively.
<P>
The medal table is a <code>String list</code> with an element for each
country appearing in results.  Each element has to be in the format "CCO
G S B" (quotes for clarity), where G, S and B are the number of gold,
silver and bronze medals won by country CCO, e.g. "AUT 1 4 1". The
numbers should not have any extra leading zeros.
<P>
Sort the elements by the number of gold medals won in decreasing order.
If several countries are tied, sort the tied countries by the number of
silver medals won in decreasing order.  If some countries are still
tied, sort the tied countries by the number of bronze medals won in
decreasing order.  If a tie still remains, sort the tied countries by
their 3-letter code in ascending alphabetical order.
</div> 
<P>
<h3>Constraints</h3>

<ul>
<LI> <code>results</code> contains between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive.
<P>
