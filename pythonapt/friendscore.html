<h2>Problem Statement</h2>

You want to determine the most popular person in a social network. To do
this, you will count the number of "2-friends" that each person
has. Person A is called a 2-friend of another person B if they are
friends with each other or if there exists some person C who is a friend
of both A and B. The most popular person is the person with the highest
number of 2-friends. (There might be more than one if multiple people
all have the maximal number of 2-friends.)
<P>
You are given a list of Strings, <code>friends</code>, where the j-th character
of the i-th element is 'Y' if person i and person j are friends, and 'N'
otherwise. Return the number of 2-friends of the most popular person in
this social network.
 <P>



</div> 
<P>
<h3>Constraints</h3>

<ul>
<LI> <code>friends</code> will contain between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive.

<P><LI> Each element of <code>friends</code> 
will contain exactly N characters 'Y' or
    'N', where N is the number of elements in <code>friends</code>.
<P>
<P>
<LI>    For each i and j, 
<code>friends[i][j]</code> will be equal to <code>friends[j][i]</code>.
<P>
<LI> For each i,  <code>friends[i][i]</code> will be equal to 'N'.
</ul>
