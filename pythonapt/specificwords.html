<h3>Examples</h3>
<ol>
<li class="example-odd">
<PRE>
phrase =  "swim trim shop drop swap rim" 
ending = "im" 
item = "sh" 


returns: 3
swim, trim and rim all end in "im", none of them have "sh" in them.
</PRE>

<P>
<li class="example-even">
<PRE>
phrase =  "swim trim shop drop swap rim" 
ending = "im" 
item = "sw" 

returns: 2
"trim" and "rim" all end in "im", and do not have "sw" in it. "swim" ends in
"im", but has "sw" as part of it. 
</PRE>

<P>
<li class="example-odd">
<PRE>
phrase = "duck" 
ending = "uck" 
item = "d"


returns: 0
</PRE>
<P>

<P>
<li class="example-even">
  <PRE>

phrase =  "i am lovely crazy silently happily smilingly funny" 
ending = "ly" 
item = "book"

lovely, silently, happily, and smilingly all end in "ly" and do not have
"book" in them. 
</PRE>

<P>
<li class="example-odd">
<PRE>


phrase = "book booklet redbook beautiful butterfly" 
ending = "ly" 
item = "book"

</PRE>

<P>
<li class="example-even">
<PRE>

phrase =  "long song long song some belong and some do not belong" 
ending = "ong" 
item = "son" 

returns: 4
There are six words that end in "ong": long, song, long, song, belong,
and belong. Two of those words have "son" in them: song and song,
so those two do not count.
</PRE>
