<h3>Specification</h3>

filename: WhichSubjects.py

def computeSubjects(phrase):
    '''
    Given the string phrase, return a phrase 
    that includes all the words from phrase that do
    not contain a digit or "-" or ":". Those words must
    be in the same order they were in  phrase. 
    '''

<h2>Problem Statement</h2>

Given a phrase, your task is to create a new phrase that includes only
those
words from the original phrase that do not have digits in them nor the
characters ":" or "-". 

<p>
You might use this method for example to extract out the subjects of the
courses that someone is taking. For example if the phrase is:

<pre>
"CompSci 101 TuTh1:25pm Econ 101 MW10:05am"
</pre>
 
Then you would return the string "CompSci Econ". You would not include words
that have digits, ":" or "-", so in this case you would not include any of
these words: "101",  
"TuTh1:25pm",  "101", and "MW10:05am".

<p> 
<p>
Write function <em>computeSubjects </em> that has one string
parameter <code>phrase</code>. 
This function returns a string of the words from phrase, in the same order,
that do not have a digit, ":", or "-".

<p>You may want to consider writing a helper function.

<h3>Constraints</h3>

<ul>
<P><li> phrase is of length 1 or more characters  </li>
<p><li> phrase is <strong>upper or lowercase </strong>alphabetic
    characters, digits, ":", "-" or
    blanks. 
<p> <li> Blank is the separator between words in phrase. That means phrase starts and ends with a non-blank character, and if there
    are blanks, there cannot be two adjacent blanks.    </li> 
</ul>


<h3>Examples</h3>
<ol>
<li class="example-odd">
<PRE>
phrase =  "CompSci 101 TuTh1:25pm Econ 101 MW10:05am"


returns: "CompSci Econ"

(example above)
</PRE>

<P>
<li class="example-even">
<PRE>
phrase =  "Math 112 CompSci 101 Bio 201 Chem 101"


returns: "Math CompSci Bio Chem"


</PRE>

<P>
<li class="example-odd">
<PRE>
phrase =  "CompSci101 Econ101"


returns: ""

Both words contain a digit, so there are no valid words to return.

</PRE>
<P>

<P>
<li class="example-even">
<PRE>


phrase =  "153FS NEUROSCI MW10:05 to11:20 Sec01 Languages207 4989" 


returns: "NEUROSCI"

NEUROSCI is the only word that does not have a digit or ":" in it. 

</PRE>
