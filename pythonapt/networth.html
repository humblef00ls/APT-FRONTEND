<h2>Problem Statement</h2>

You've been asked to help manage reports on how
often people spend money using Venmo and whether
they receive more money than they pay out. The input
to your program is a list of transactions from Venmo.
Each transaction has the same form:
<code>"from:to:amount"</code> where <em>from</em> is
the name of the person paying <em>amount</em> dollars
to the person whose name is <em>to</em>. The value
of <em>amount</em> will be a valid float 
<b>with at most
two decimal places.</b>
<P>
Return a list of strings that has each person who appears in
any transaction with the net cash flow through Venmo that
person has received. Every cent paid by the person to
someone else is a pay-out and every cent received by
a person is a pay-in. The difference between pay-out and
	  pay-in is the cash flow received. This will be negative for
each person who pays out more than they get via pay-in. See the examples
for details.
<P>
The list returned should be sorted by name. Strings in the list
returned are in the format "name:netflow" where the netflow
is obtained by using <code>str(val)</code> where val
is a float representing the net cash flow for that person.
<P>
<b>Store money as <code>int</code> values, multiplying by 100 
and dividing by 100 as needed for processing input and output,
respectively.</b>


</div> 
<P>
<h3>Constraints</h3>

<ul>
<P><li>All entries in <code>transactions</code> will be in the correct
	  format, all characters are lower case letters and the amount
	  is a valid float with at most two decimal values.</li>
<P><li> There will be at most 50 elements of <code>transactions</code></li>
<P><li>Each amount in <code>transactions</code> will be greater than 0
	  and less than 1000.
</ul>


<h3>Examples</h3>
<ol>
<li class="example-odd">
<PRE>
transactions: ["owen:susan:10", "owen:robert:10", "owen:drew:10"]

returns ['drew:10.0', 'owen:-30.0', 'robert:10.0', 'susan:10.0']
</PRE>
Owen pays everyone. 
<P>
<li class="example-even">
<PRE>
transactions: ["fred:ricky:50", "ricky:fred:20", "fred:ethel:100", "ethel:fred:150.35"]

returns: ['ethel:-50.35', 'fred:20.35', 'ricky:30.0']
</PRE>
Ethel is out $50.35 after taking in $100, but paying out $150.35. Fred
	  gets money from two people, but pays ricky $50. Ricky
pays out $20 and takes in $50, so his  cashflow  in is $30.
<P>
<li class="example-odd">
<PRE>
transactions = ["adam:eve:123"]

returns ['adam:-123.0', 'eve:123.0']
</PRE>
