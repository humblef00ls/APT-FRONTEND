<h3>Specification</h3>
<xmp>
  filename: AnagramFree.py

  def getMaximumSubset(words):
      """
      return int value that represents
      size of largest anagram-free subset
      of values in words, a list of strings
      """

<h2>Problem Statement</h2>

A string X is an anagram of string Y if X can be obtained by arranging
all characters of Y in some order, without removing any characters and
without adding new characters. For example, each of the strings "baba",
"abab", "aabb" and "abba" is an anagram of "aabb", and strings "aaab",
"aab" and "aabc" are not anagrams of "aabb".
<P>


A set of strings is anagram-free if it contains no pair of strings which
are anagrams of each other. Given a set of strings <codE>words</code>,
return the size of its largest anagram-free subset. Note that the entire
set is considered a subset of itself.



</div> 
<P>
<h3>Constraints</h3>

<ul>
<P><li> <code>words</code> will contain between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive
<P><li> Each element of <code>words</code> contains between 1 and 50
	  characters, inclusive
<P><li> Each element of <code>words</code> will consist of lowercase
	  letters 'a' -- 'z' only
<p><li> All elements of <code>words</code> will be distinct.
</ul>


<h3>Examples</h3>
<ol>
<li class="example-odd">
<PRE>
words = ["abcd","abdc","dabc","bacd"]

Returns: 1


</PRE>
All of the strings in <code>words</code> are anagrams of each other, so
no two of them can simultaneously belong to an anagram-free set.
<P>

<li class="example-even">
<PRE>
words = ["abcd","abac","aabc","bacd"]

Returns: 2


</PRE>
One of the maximum anagram-free subsets is ["abcd","abac"].
<P>
<li class="example-odd">
<PRE>
words = ["aa","aaaaa","aaa","a","bbaaaa","aaababaa"]

Returns: 6

</PRE>
Note that strings of different length cannot be anagrams of each other.
<P>
<li class="example-even">
<PRE>
words = ["creation","sentence","reaction","sneak","star","rats","snake"]

Returns: 4

</PRE>
