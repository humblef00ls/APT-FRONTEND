          kth item in the list items

<h2>Problem Statement</h2>


To make packing faster you've decided to implement the function
<code>boxes</code> that tells you what item goes in which box and the
order to put the items in (heaviest first). You have a list of
<code>items</code> and a parallel list of <code>weights</code>, where
the k<sup>th</sup> item in <code>items</code> has the k<sup>th</sup> weight in
<code>weights</code>. You must use <code>n</code> boxes to pack things.
<P>

When choosing which of <code>n</code> boxes to put an item in, you
always choose the <em>lightest/least heavy</em> box, even if it has
more items in it. You put items into each box in order of individual
items from heaviest to lightest. First put the heaviest item in the
lightest box, then the next heaviest item in the lightest box, and so
on. See below for tie-breaking information.

<p>
The function returns a list of strings, where each string represents a
single box of all the items that go in it, separated by a single
space. In each single box (a string) the space-separated items are listed from heavest to 
lightest.  The list of strings returned is in alphabetical order.

<p>

To create your return value, first sort the items by weight with
heaviest first, break ties alphabetically. For example, a 
<em>book</em> with
weight 2, a <em>doll</em> with weight 1, and a 
<em>car</em> with weight 1 would be
ordered <em>book</em>, <em>car</em>, and <em>doll</em> 
because the book is the heaviest and although
car and doll weigh the same, car comes before doll
alphabetically. Process these weighted items in order,
always putting the next
heaviest item in the box that is the lightest. If there is more than
one box that is the lightest, use the first one in your list you're returning.

<h3>Constraints</h3>

<ul>
<P><li><code>len(items) == len(weights)</code>
<P><li><code>n <= len(items)</code>
<P><Li> There will be no more than 50 elements in the list parameters.
</ul>


<h3>Examples</h3>
<ol>

<li class="example-odd">
<PRE>
items = ['pens', 'mug', 'book']
weights = [1, 3, 2]
n = 3

Returns ['book', 'mug', 'pens']
</PRE>
# When we order the items by weight we get <code>['mug', 'book', 'pens']</code>, then we put them in our boxes to get the list <code>['mug', 'book', 'pens']</code>, finally we return <code>['book', 'mug', 'pens']</code> because that is in alphabetical order.
<P>

<li class="example-even">
<PRE>
items = ['fan', 'ball', 'book']
weights = [1, 2, 3]
n = 2

Returns ['ball fan', 'book']
</PRE>
# When we order the items by weight we get <code>['book', 'ball', 'fan']</code>, then we put them in our boxes to get the list <code>['book', 'ball fan']</code>, finally we return <code>['ball fan', 'book']</code> because that is in alphabetical order.
