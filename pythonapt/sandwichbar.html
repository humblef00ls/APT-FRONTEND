<h2>Problem Statement</h2>


It's time to get something to eat and I've come across a sandwich
bar. Like most people, I prefer certain types of sandwiches. In fact, I
keep a list of the types of sandwiches I like.
<P>
The sandwich bar has certain ingredients available. I will list the
types of sandwiches I like in order of preference and buy the first
sandwich the bar can make for me. In order for the bar to make a
sandwich for me, it must include all of the ingredients I desire.
<P>
Given <code>available</code>, a list of Strings/ingredients the
sandwich bar can use, and a <code>orders</code>, a list of Strings
that represent the types of
sandwiches I like, in order of preference (most preferred first), return
the 0-based index of the sandwich I will buy. Each element of
<code>orders</code> represents one type of sandwich I like as a
space-separated list of ingredients in the sandwich. If the bar can make
no sandwiches I like, return -1.
<P> 

</div> 
<P>
<h3>Constraints</h3>

<ul>
<li>	<code>available</code>
 will contain between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive.
<P><li>	Each element of <code>available</code> 
will contain between 1 and 50 lowercase letters ('a' - 'z'), inclusive.
<P><li> <code>orders</ocde> will contain between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive.
<P><li> Each element of <code>orders</code> will 
contain between 1 and 50 lowercase letters ('a' - 'z') and spaces, inclusive.

<P><li> Each element of <code>orders</code> will represent a list of
desired ingredients separated by single spaces, with no leading or
trailing spaces.
</ul>

<PRE>

available = [ "ham", "cheese", "mustard" ]

orders = [ "ham cheese" ]

I only like plain ham and cheese sandwiches, and since both ham and cheese are available, I'll take that.

<P>
<li class="example-even">
<PRE>


available = [ "cheese", "mustard", "lettuce" ]

orders = [ "cheese ham", "cheese mustard lettuce", "ketchup", "beer" ]

</pre>
They've run out of ham, but I'll consider other options now.
<P>

available = [ "cheese", "cheese", "cheese", "tomato" ]
