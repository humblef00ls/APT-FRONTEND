<h2>Problem Statement</h2>

You are in charge of web-based orders for your neighborhood bagel store,
<em>The Bagel Byte</em>. Each evening you must total the orders to be
picked up the next day. Some orders are simply for <em>N</em> bagels,
but each order of a dozen or more bagels is topped off with an extra
bagel, the so-called "baker's dozen".  This means, for example, that an
order for 25 bagels actually requires 27 bagels to fulfill since there
are two extra bagels needed for each dozen in the order. An order for 11
bagels doesn't require any extra since it's for less than a dozen.
<P>
Given a list of integers representing
bagel orders determine the number of bagels needed to
fulfill all the orders.

<h3>Constraints</h3>

<ul>
<LI>  The list <code>orders</code> will contain between 0 and 50
	elements.
<p>
<LI> Each element of <code>orders</code> will be between 1 and 60 (no
	one orders more than five dozen at-a-time).	
</ul>


<h3>Examples</h3>
<ol>
<li class="example-odd">
<PRE>
orders = [1,3,5,7]

Returns:  16

</PRE>
No order is for more than a dozen, return the total of all orders.
<P>
<li class="example-even">
<PRE>

orders = [11,22,33,44,55]

Returns: 175 since 11 + (22+1) +(33+2) + (44+3) + (55+4) = 175

</PRE>
