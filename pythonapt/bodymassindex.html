<h2>Problem Statement</h2>

Body mass index (BMI) is a measure of body size, which is often calculated
by medical professionals. BMI is calculated based on a person's height and
weight. How this calculation depends on the metrics used. 

<p>For height in inches and weight in pounds, BMI is calculated as: 
<br><br>
(weight/height<sup>2</sup>) x 703
</p>

<p>Given a list of a patient's weight and height, we want to determine a
person's BMI. Create the function named <code>calculateBMI</code> that has 
one parameter named input, which is a list of integers. The list is in the 
format [weight, height], where weight is the person's weight, and height 
is a person's height.
</p>

<p>This function returns the BMI, based on the input.</p>

</div> 
<P>
<h3>Constraints</h3>
<ul>
<P><li>The list only contains one weight and one height.
<P><li>weight is an integer in the range of 1-800.
<P><li>height is an integer in the range of 1-84.
<P><li>The BMI returned is an integer value that rounds down to the closest 
integer.
</ul>


<h3>Examples</h3>
<ol>

<li class="example-odd">
<PRE>
input=[100,60]

Returns: 19
</PRE>
# A person who is 5ft tall and weighs 100 lbs has a BMI of 19.527777777777775. 
However, because we're only considering the integer portion, only 19 is returned
<P>

<li class="example-even">
<PRE>
input=[160,65]

Returns: 26
</PRE>
# A person who is 5ft 5in tall and weighs 160 lbs has a BMI of 26.622485207100592. 
However, because we're only considering the integer portion, only 26 is returned
<P>

<li class="example-odd">
<PRE>
input=[80,50]

Returns: 22
</PRE>
# A person who is 4ft 2in tall and weighs 80 lbs.
<P>

<li class="example-even">
<PRE>
input=[325,77]

Returns: 38
</PRE>
# A person who is 6ft 5in tall and weighs 325 lbs.
