<h3>Specification</h3>
<xmp>
filename: SortCount.py

def occurrences(letter, words):
    '''
    letter is a string of one lowercase alphabetic letter
    words is a list of words
    return a sorted list of the unique words by the number of times
       letter occurs in each word. Break ties alphabetically. 
    '''
</xmp>
</div>
<h2>Problem Statement</h2>

Write the function named  <code>occurrences</code> that has two 
parameters, <code>letter</code> that is a single lowercase alphabetic
letter, 
and <code>words</code>, a   list of words.
This function returns 
a sorted list of the unique words in order based on the number of
occurrence of <code> letter</code>. Ties should be broken alphabetically.  

</div> 
<P>
<h3>Constraints</h3>

<ul>
<P><li> letter is a lowercase letter, one of a-z  
<P><li> words  is a list of 0 or more words, each word is a String of
    one or more lowercase letters from a-z   </li>
</ul>


<h3>Examples</h3>
<ol>
<li class="example-odd">
<PRE>
letter = "e" 
words = ["one", "two", "three"] 

returns: ["two", "one", "three"]
 
"two" is first as it has no 'e', "one" is next as it has one 'e', and
"three" is last as it has two 'e's.    
</PRE>

<P>
<li class="example-even">
<PRE>
letter = "o" 
words = ["one", "two", "three"] 

returns: ["three", "one", "two"]
 
"three" is first as it has no "o". Both "one" and "two" have one "o", so
they are sorted alphabetically. 

</PRE>

<P>
<li class="example-odd">
<PRE>
letter = "t" 
words = ["one", "two", "three", "wait", "one", "two", "three", "go"]

returns: ["go", "one", "three", "two", "wait"]

Both "go" and "one" have no "t", they are sorted and come first. The rest of
the words all have one "t", they are sorted and come next.   
 
</PRE>
<P>

<P>
<li class="example-even">
<PRE>
letter = "r" 
words = ["plum", "apple", "lemon", "banana", "kiwi", "apricot", "blueberry", "pear"] 

returns: ["apple", "banana", "kiwi", "lemon", "plum", "apricot", "pear", "blueberry"]

The words "apricot" and "pear" each have one "r", and "blueberry" has two
"r"s. The other words come first as they do not have any 'r's, followed by
'apricot' and  'pear', followed by 'blueberry'.
</PRE>
