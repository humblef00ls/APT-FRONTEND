<h2>Problem Statement</h2>

You are investigating a robbery, and you are sure the robbery was
committed by one of the suspects you have information on. Each element
of suspects will contain a number of characteristics of that suspect in
a comma separated list. For example, suppose we had the following list
of suspects:
<ul>
    <LI> suspect 0: "blond,tall,skinny"
    <LI> suspect 1: "short,skinny,blond,tattooed"
    <LI> suspect 2: "scarred,bald"
</UL>

You may assume that if a characteristic is not on the list for a suspect
then that characteristic does not apply - so in this case we can be sure
that suspect 0 is not "tattooed" or "bald" or anything else other than
what's listed. Therefore, if we knew that the culprit was "tattooed", we
would know for sure that suspect 1 is the guilty party. However, if we
knew that the culprit was "skinny" and "blond" we would still be unsure
whether suspect 0 or suspect 1 was the robber.
<P>
Return the maximum number of facts we could know such that the facts:
<P>
<ol>
   <LI> Are all consistent with at least one of the suspects.
   <LI> Do not uniquely identify the culprit.
</ol>
In the example above, the value is 2. We could know that the suspect is
"skinny" and "blond" - but if we knew anything more than that about the
culprit then we would be able to identify the culprit uniquely (or the
facts would no longer be consistent with any of the suspects).

<h3>Constraints</h3>

<ul>
<LI> <code>suspects</code> will contain between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive.
<P>
<LI>	Each element of <code>suspects</code> 
will contain between 1 and 50 characters, inclusive.
<P>
<LI> Elements of <code>suspects</code> will contain only lowercase letters ('a'-'z') and commas (',').
<P>
<LI>	Each element of <code>suspects</code> will not have a comma
	    (',') as the first or last character.
<P>
<LI>	Each element of <code>suspects</code> will not contain two adjacent commas.
<P>
<LI>	Each element of <code>suspects</code> will not contain the same characteristic more than once.
</ul>


<h3>Examples</h3>
<ol>
<li class="example-odd">
<PRE>

["blond,tall,skinny",
"short,skinny,blond,tattooed",
"scarred,bald"]

Returns: 2
</PRE>
The example from the problem statement.

<P>
<li class="example-even">
<PRE>
["gigantic,fluorescent,loud,male"]

Returns: 0
</PRE>

There's only one subject, and he should be easy to find. We cannot know
any facts without being able to make a positive ID. 
<P>    	

<li class="example-odd">
<PRE>
["medium,average,nondescript",
"medium,average,nondescript"]

Returns: 3
</PRE>
<P>
There's no way to tell these two apart - so we could know all 3 facts
without being able to make an ID.

<P>
<li class="example-even">
<PRE>
["big,tall,loud,happy,male,scarred,tattooed,dirty",
"short,male,beard,quiet,happy,tanned,handsome",
"female,pretty,blond,quiet",
"somnambulistic",
"happy,tiny,stout,male,tanned,beard,blond"]

Returns: 4



Explanation:

Here there are five suspects. Compare each suspect with every other suspect
to see the maximum number of traits in common between any two.

Suspect 1 compared to suspect 2 have two things in common: "happy"
and "male".

Suspect 1 compared to suspect 3 have nothing in common.

Suspect 1 compared to suspect 4 have nothing in common.

Suspect 1 compared to suspect 5 have "happy", and "male", 2 things in
common.

Suspect 2 compared to suspect 3 have "quiet" in common, 1 thing

Suspect 2 compared to suspect 4 have nothing in common

Suspect 2 compared to suspect 5 have "male", "beard", "happy", and
"tanned", 4 things.

Suspect 3 compared to suspect 4 have nothing in common.

Suspect 3 compared to suspect 5 have one thing in common, "blond".

Suspect 4 compared to suspect 5 have nothing in common.

The largest number of items in common between two suspects is 4, between
suspect 2 and 5, so return 4.
