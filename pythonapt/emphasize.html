<h2>Problem Statement</h2>

Given a word and a number we want to emphasize the first part of the word
by repeating the first part "number" times. But there are a few rules about
what you can repeat. Your code should follow these rules.

<p>
<ul> 
<li> If the first letter starts with a vowel, there is <em>no change</em> to the word.
</li> 
<li> If none of the first three letters is a vowel, then 
there is <em>no change</em> to the word.
</li> 
<li> If the third letter is a vowel, then the first three letters are
  repeated <tt>number</tt> times. 
</li> 
<li> If the third letter is not a vowel, but the second letter is a vowel,
  the the first two letters are repeated <tt>number</tt> times.
</li> 
<li> Only the first letter of the returned word may be a capital letter,
and then only if the original word started with a capital letter. 
</li> 

</ul>
<P>
Write function <code>repeat</code> that given a word and a number returns
the word with the first part repeated <tt>number</tt> times 
if the first part is valid (there is a vowel, but the first letter
is not a vowel, see rules). 

<P>
</div> 
<P>
<h3>Constraints</h3>

<ul>
<P><li> <code>word</code> is formed of alphabetic letters and only the
    first letter will be a capital letter. 
</li>

<p> <li> There is at least one letter in
    <code>word</code>. Be sure to consider how to handle words that are of
    length one or two. 
</li>

<P><li> <code>number </code> is greater than 1
</li>

</ul>


<h3>Examples</h3>
<ol>
<li class="example-odd">
<PRE>
word = "Chocolate"

number = 3

returns "Chochochocolate" 
</PRE>
since the third letter is a vowel so "cho" is
repeated
three times
<P>
<li class="example-even">
<PRE>
word = "banana"

number = 4

returns "babababanana"
</PRE>
The second letter is a vowel, so "ba" is repeated four times.
<P>
<li class="example-odd">
<PRE>
word = "apple"

number = 2

returns "apple"
</PRE>
Starts with a vowel, so no change.
<P>
<li class="example-even">
<PRE>
word = "Foofy"

number = 4 

returns "Foofoofoofoofy"

</PRE>
<P>
<li class="example-odd">
<PRE>
word = "stripe"

number = 3

returns "stripe"
</PRE>

Neither the second or third letter are a vowel, so no change.
<P>
<li class="example-even">
<PRE>
word = "Abercrombie"

number = 6 

returns "Abercrombie"
</PRE>

Starts with a vowel, so no change.
