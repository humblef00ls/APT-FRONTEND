<h3>Specification</h3>
<xmp>
  Filename: Consensus.py

  def majorityWinner(voteA, voteB, voteC):
      '''
      voteA (int) - Number of votes received by candidate A
      voteB (int) - Number of votes received by candidate B
      voteC (int) - Number of votes received by candidate C
    
      Returns a string representing which candidate won the majority vote, based
      on the three parameters. If there is no majority winner, return "No one".
      '''
      return ''
</xmp>
</div>
<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
Winning the majority vote means receiving strictly more than half of the votes. Write a function that determines who won the majority vote among three candidates A, B, or C. If no one won the majority vote, return the string "No one" (note: A, B, C, and N are capitalized).
