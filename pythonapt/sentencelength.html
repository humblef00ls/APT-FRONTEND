<h2>Problem Statement</h2>

As part of analyzing readability you've been asked to compute

<P>
<h3>Constraints</h3>

<ul>
<P><li> <code>sentenceList</code> will have between
1 and 50 strings in it, inclusive of 1 and 50.
<P><li> Each string in <code>sentenceList</code> will
contain between 1 and 50 words, words delimited by
whitespace.
</ul>


<h3>Examples</h3>
<ol>
<li class="example-odd">
<PRE>
sentenceList = ["the", "cat", "ate", "the", "dog"]

returns 1.0
