<h2>Problem Statement</h2>


You have used your secret mind-reading device to find out how every
voter will vote in the next election. Your mind-reading device also
revealed to you that all the voters are prepared to change their vote if
you pay them enough.
<P>
The <code>i</code><sup>th</sup> element of <code>votes</code> (list of
integers) is the number of people who were originally planning to vote
for candidate <code>i</code>. Return the minimum number of votes that
you must change to ensure that candidate 0 (your favorite) will have
more votes than any other candidate.
<P>


</div> 
<P>
<h3>Constraints</h3>

<ul>
 <LI> <code>votes</code> will contain between 1 and 50 elements,
 inclusive.  
 <P><LI> Each element of <code>votes</code> will be between
 1 and 100, inclusive.
</ul>


<h3>Examples</h3>
<ol>
<li class="example-odd">
<PRE>

[5, 7, 7]

Returns: 2

</PRE>
Buying one vote from each of the other two candidates leaves candidate 0
with 7 votes and the others with 6 each.
<P>
<li class="example-even">
<PRE>

[10, 10, 10, 10]

Returns: 1

</PRE>
You need strictly more votes than all other candidates, so you need to
    buy one vote.
<P>
<li class="example-odd">
<PRE>

[1]

Returns: 0

</PRE>
If you are the only candidate, you automatically win.
