<h3>Specification</h3>
<xmp>
  filename: Common.py

  def count(a,b):
      """
      return the integer number of characters in common
      to Strings a and b as described below 
      """

      #you write code here

<h2>Problem Statement</h2>

Two strings have a letter in common if it appears in both strings.  The
position of letter is not important for it to be counted as common.
Once a particular letter is counted as <EM>in common</EM>, it cannot be
counted again.  For example, an <EM>o</EM> appearing twice in one word
but only once in the other counts only as one letter in common. However,
an <EM>o</EM> appearing twice in both words counts as two letters in common.

<P>
Write a function that takes two strings and returns the number of
letters they have in common.

<P>
Hint: you will need some way to avoid counting a letter more than once
if it is in common to both words, creating a list from the characters in
a String may help since lists are mutable and strings are not.

<h3>Constraints</h3>

<ul>
<P><li>Strings a and b are the same length
<P><li>Each string only contains characters in the range 'a'-'z'
</ul>
