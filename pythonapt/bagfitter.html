<h2>Problem Statement</h2>


You have just begun working as a grocery bagger at a
food store. Your job is to place all of a customer's items into bags, so
they can be carried from the store. Your manager has instructed you to
use as few bags as possible, to minimize the store's overall
cost. However, for the customer's convenience, you are instructed that
only items of the same type can be placed in the same bag. For instance,
a produce item can be bagged with any other produce items, but not with
dairy items.
<P>

You are given <code>food</code>, a list of strings, indicating the type of
each item that needs to be bagged. You are also given an <code>
strength</code>, an int, indicating the maximum number of items that can be
placed in each bag (each bag holds the same maximal number of item,
regardless of the type of item). You are to return an int indicating the minimum
number of bags required to package the customer's items.


</div> 
<P>
<h3>Constraints</h3>

<ul>
<li> <code>strength</code> will be between 1 and 50, inclusive.
<P><Li> <code>food</code> will contain between 0 and 50 elements, inclusive.
<P><LI> Each element of <code>food</code> will contain between 1 and 50 characters,
    inclusive.
<P><LI>Each element of <code>food</code> will contain only the characters 'A'-'Z'.

</ul>


<h3>Examples</h3>
<ol>
<li class="example-odd">
<PRE>
strength = 2

food = 
["DAIRY",
 "DAIRY",
 "PRODUCE",
 "PRODUCE",
 "PRODUCE",
 "MEAT"]

Returns: 4

</PRE>

Here, you have six items. You could put two items in each bag, but you
would have to mix item types. The single meat item must get its own
bag. The two dairy items fit in one bag. The three produce items will
require two bags.
<P>
<li class="example-even">
<PRE>
strength = 3

food = 
["DAIRY",
 "DAIRY",
 "PRODUCE",
 "PRODUCE",
 "PRODUCE",
 "MEAT"
]

Returns: 3

</PRE>
Similar to above, but now we have stronger bags. Note again, though,
that if we were allowed to mix item types, we could get away with only 2
bags. But since item types cannot be mixed, we need 3 bags.
<P>

<li class="example-odd">
<PRE>
strength = 10

food = []

Returns: 0

</PRE>
The bags are really strong, but we didn't buy anything.
<P>
<li class="example-even">
<PRE>
strength = 5

food =
["CANNED",   "CANNED",  "PRODUCE",
 "DAIRY",    "MEAT",    "BREAD",
 "HOUSEHOLD","PRODUCE", "FROZEN",
 "PRODUCE", "DAIRY"
]

Returns: 7

</PRE>
Notice that a customer doesn't necessarily pay for the items in any
    particular order, but the bagger still has to be responsible for
    sorting them out. In this case, though, one bag for each item type
    suffices.
<P>
<li class="example-odd">
<PRE>
strength = 2

food =
["CANNED",   "CANNED",  "PRODUCE",
 "DAIRY",    "MEAT",    "BREAD",
 "HOUSEHOLD","PRODUCE", "FROZEN",
 "PRODUCE", "DAIRY"
]

Returns: 8

</PRE>
As above, but our produce requires two bags now.
