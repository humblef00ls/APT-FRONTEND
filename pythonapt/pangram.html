  filename: Pangram.py

  def getStats(sentence):
      '''
      sentence (str) - a string with a potential pangram in it
      
      For all the letters return a list where value at the kth index is the
      number of letters that occur k times.
      '''
      return []

<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
Pangrams are sentences where every letter of the alphabet is used at least once. Some even have each letter appear only once. Implement <code>getStats</code> that takes a sentence and returns a list where the value at the k<sup>th</sup> index is the number of letters that appeared k times, e.g., the
value at index 0 is the number of letters that did not appear at all, index 1 is the number of letters that only appeared once, index 2 is the number of letters that only appeared twice, etc.
<p>
Do not count upper and lower case letters as different. And the list should only be as long as needed (it shouldn't end with 0's).

<h3>Constraints</h3>

<ul>
<P><li>The sentence may have punctuation, which should be ignored.
<P><li>There are only 26 letters in the alphabet: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
</ul>
