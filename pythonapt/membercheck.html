<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
A health club chain allows its members to visit any of its many health
    club locations an unlimited number of times per day. The only
    constraining rule is, a customer can only visit one health club
    location per day, even though he or she may return to that location
    an unlimited number of times for the rest of that day.
<P>
Although the honor system has always worked quite well, the club wants
    to run some tests to see how many people really follow the
    rules. You are to write a program that takes the entrance log files
    from three different clubs (all logging the same day) and return a
    sorted list of the people who are not honest and went to more than
    one health club location in the same day.
<P>

The log files are represented as lists of <code>String</code>'s
where each element is the
    member name of a customer who entered that day. For example, if a
    customer showed up three times to one of the club locations that
    day, the member's name would appear three times in the corresponding
    list of Strings.
</div> 
<h3>Notes</h3>
<UL>
<LI> <code>club1</code>, <code>club2</code>, and <code>club3</code> 
may contain a different number of elements.
<P>
<LI> The same member name can appear multiple times in a single log file.
<LI> The elements of the returned <code>String</code> list
should be sorted in
lexicographic order (the order they would appear in a dictionary).
<P>
<LI> Assume that two people with the same name are in fact the same person.
</UL> 
<P>
<h3>Constraints</h3>

<ul>
<LI> <code>club1</code>, <code>club2</code>, and <code>club3</code> each have between 1 and 50 elements,
      inclusive.

<p><LI> Each element of <code>club1</code>, <code>club2</code>, and <code>club3</code> contains between 1 and 50 characters, inclusive.
<p><LI> Each element of <code>club1</code>, <code>club2</code>, and <code>club3</code> consists only of uppercase letters ('A'-'Z').
</ul>
